AFTER 2 WEEKS OF DAILY 1-2 HR USEPROS:Sound quality is ear deafening... u can use it with 70-80% more than that u cant ..or u r crazy ...BASS 5/5I feel the price is affordable.5/5The wire are very durable 5/5(Wires with nylon outer cover as of i know )the buttons 5/5I use it as a daily driver in gym it wont come unless u take it out.Cons: After using it for 60-70 minutes you will feel slight discomfort due to the ear wing and  also you feel discomfort whiling  using it in while on a pillow in bed.( the ear hooks are detachable) it gives more comfort.but it is the best wired headset in the range and it is better than their own 225 headphones...i highly recommend it for people who need A good bass headphones
"I was looking for midrange earphones from quite sometime for my workouts and running .but this piece of earphone is upto my mark asIt is perfectly grip in my ears no fear of falling while running,Clear and metallic soundGood bass ,Look wise it is awesome.Braided wire means strengthAfter using it for few days there is change in sound pattern  so I returned it. And I'm changing my review from 5 stars to 2"
Loved this earphone its bass is out standing... build quality is great...if you're getting it for 449... Grab it. It's better than boat 225 and ant w56.. good for jogging. Design is not so Good but build quality is great. Get black color earphones. And cherry on top is it's has volume control buttons too... nobody gives volume control buttons in this price.
As they promised that the quality of wire is too good but it is not.. the wire got damaged with in very short time at the joint as shown in the pic. I cannot replace now not sure how to claim warranty. Can someone (Amazon) help me to get this replaced or repaired?I will mark it as 5 star if it is replaced.
"Excellent bass above 70% of volume. Sometime you will feel vibration of bass in 100% volume.😀Nice build quality.Ear tip fits well.You get this earphone, extra pair of eartip (small and large) and collor clip in the box. Neon green colour looks very nice.Didn't find any con after listening to 12-15 different genres songs, call quality is also good.Go for it in this price range (450-500).Though I received an open box but its not related to product quality. 1 less star for delivery and packing."
"This is a product review after using it for straight 2 hours since it just got delivered today.What an improvement firstly from the boat bassheads 225.Now, i dont know what the other negative reviews are about since i personally did not find any issue whatsoever with these infact i am delighted by it.If you are looking a for a good wired earphone and dont want to spend much then this would be the best budget earphone in the market right now.Firstly speaking of the body it is plastic and not metallic and so it has become lighter than the previous bassheads so much that after using it for 2 straight hours i almost forgot i had them put on. I just felt the wire could have been a bit thicker but dont forget the wire is braided and coated with a rubber like material which should resolve that dilemma.These come with ear hooks which to my surprise were so comfortable. I usually hate ear hooks cause they hurt after a while but these are just so soft and fit right in.Moving on the main purpose and the bigger question ""BASS"".I would say it's perfect.The sound quality is so very crisp and clear.BASS is in the right spot and according to me you dont need anymore.You may hear from other reviewers the BASS is not as good as the previous bassheads please understand it depends on what kind of music you listen and mostly the KBPS which is kilo bits per second. The higher the kbps the better the sound including bass and treble.The loudness is great almost deafening at the highest volume.To check noise cancellation (although these earphones dont say noise cancellation) I made a few phone calls and asked if they heard any background noise and they said they could hear little to nothing of whats happening in the background. Now ofcourse this is in a normal environment and may not cancel the traffic sounds or a loud background noise.The added advantage is the IPX4 sweat and water resistance (you dont find this feature in most wired earphones atleast not in this price range) which is great specially when you work out or when you are jogging or talking a walk. Although since it is wired you will find discomfort and so may want to get wireless bluetooth earphones instead.So heres how i would rate it on a scale of 1 - 5, 5 being the highest and 1 being the lowest.Price: 5Build Quality: 4.5 ( Only cause i think the wire could have been a little thicker)Loudness: 5Call Quality: 5Bass: 5 (The bass is just perfect if any more bass than this you'd better be putting your ears on a  loudspeaker).Hope this clarifies your doubts about this product.All in all yet another great product from BOAT and you wont regret the purchase."
"I purchased this boat hadset, initially it was working excellent but after 2 months, I don't know whether it's a design issues or might be other problem, I contacted service center of boat. They denied to replace my headphone, staff said me that it's a special cricketer editon so I need to complain via online from the boat website and I registered a complete raised ticket but still now no reply. Poor service. till date no reply from  BOAT. kindly think before buying boat products."
"This is the true earphone to connect you to nirvana not for longer times because it starts pain in ear after a long time continuous use.Bass- in the price of 450, bass is terrible. You will get powerful bass than you expect.Sound- if a headphone has poor sound, it is not a headphone. But this one has the sound that will blow your mind totally.Noice cancellation- in the price range of 400-500 no brand will give you perfect noice cancellation headphones, but in boat bassheads, there is noice cancellation but not so good.Overall- if you have 500 rs. And you are searching for beast headphone in you budget and if you are reading reviews, and if you are reading this one, i am telling you go for it without hesitation beacuse after a long research on 2 shopping sites i found thi product best in my price range.(i bouggt it for 450)."
It is second day of my usage. I went for run with this ear phones. They claim to be sweat proof but after 2 minutes of run my mic and volume button are giving false signals. Automatically music gets change and volume goes to zero all of sudden. I think this is because of sweat and mic is mis-operating.I think we should not call earphones sweat protection if any of the system is friendly for sweat. completely disappointed with product.
"Just overdid it on the bass. There is virtually no treble. The singers voice just gets muted. Good for pew pew Hindi, pop, hip-hop type songs. I guess that's why they are sold in India. Not for metalheads! Also the eargrips are uncomfortable after long use. Needless addition. Durability I will comment a few months later. But for the price can't complain. It's no Bose."
"If you want durable earphone, protected from sweat, water. Go for this.Build quality: Very good form factor, braided cable with waterproof coating. Eartips are comfortable and fits nicely, looks durable.Sound: Boat earphone, hence Bass rich, treble and mids could have been better (as I listen music in studio monitors, so I felt, not a big issue)Downsides: Wire seems very durable, but not too thick. Could've been thicker. Extra eartips only 2 small and 2 mediums. Couldve been provided more.Overall you can surely take this if you badly need waterproofing and durability, otherwise 225/152/162 has slightly better sound. But this has volume control keys, thats a plus point."
"Before these earphones, I used the basic Samsung earphones which were 5 years old.And I am writing this review after 3 days of usage,daily for 3-4 hours.Pros:  1- Crystal clear & loud sound.  5/52- Amazing bass.  5/53-Call quality is fine. 4/54- The wires are braided which make them more durable.  5/5One of the most amazing features is that you get sound control buttons in this earphones which work as a charm.Cons :1- After continuous use for 45-60 mins, they cause pain in ears.2- They are MADE IN CHINA.  I didn't know it before.Edit: After daily usage of almost 1 week, the right earplug is not working properly and they are causing hell lot of pain and itchiness on the ear.I am reducing the rating from 4 stars to 1. Also I have applied for replacement.I really wish, somehow refund would be possible, as I don't want to waste 500 Rs."
"Best for me. If you fall in the middle category, where you don't want the best of the best earphones but also don't want the worst, go for this.Earbuds don't fall from my ears! My ears are kind of weird. Like Amir Khan (lol). (I have had a bad past with regards to this with my previous earphones).Bass is gooood. Sound clarity is also good. Some experts may say the vocal clarity is overshadowed by the bass, but I am okay with that.The clip is very useful in preventing the earbuds from falling. I clip it on my collar.The cable strength is also good. The cable got pulled twice by accident, and nothing happened to the earphones.The mic is also good. I use these earphones to listen to music, watch YouTube, calling, send and listen to voice notes, etc.Best. Cheers!Don't think too much :)"
Worst sound. It's like someone is poking you with a needle in your ears. Great design but no use. Got ear pain within two days of using this. Sharp painful sound at higher volumes. Somehow managing with low volumes. Bad bass. Worthless.
"One side of these ear plugs stopped working within 3 weeks. The number that was written/given for the warranty related issues is not correct. No other way to contact the seller....Hope they will react now after seeing  my review.... Otherwise good product, only if it worked properly for some time."
"bass is better than boat 225, sennheiser cx180, sennheiser cx213 and sony mdr EX15AP. also tangle free, at this price of 549, it is worth of money.drawback is your you cant use this product for long time........"
by look and sound it was goodBut it has a very poor quality of wire which has been a problem of BOat.This is my 3rd boat earphone which one side is stopped working... replacement earphone quality is also of same quality usually lasts for 1-2 months only.it has zero noise cancellation dont think about taking calls using it
"Earler ive used jbl, philips, sony and mi earphones. But this stands top of all.  And i personally call it baap of all in this price segment.  Even 1500 segment of jbl and sanheiser.  The moment i plugged in these earphones and played muqabla.. I just stood up from my chair.... As well as all my hair on hands.. What else i can say... Just go for it.. Please dont search for anything else and waste your time.  Ive done a lot of review. Sent back few earphones coz of some problem.  But this is all rounder."
"Don't buy this model of Boat..It is useless, no sound quality, no bass..I really wonder how customers are giving wrong feedback..I have been using Boat products for almost 4 years now, but this one is a waste.. Don't buy this model of boat earphone.Aside, shame to the seller....he is sending used product...the package was opened and used.."
"Great product...Great sound ....And got it on deal price 449...In this price, they give volume control with great sound quality. ....must buy product"
"In this price range it's the best option. If you have higher budget it's not the best. The problems I faced are high bass at higher volume levels, destroying the song... Recommend listening at 65 to 75 for best results (pretty good clarity at this level). Next is usage time after like 1to 2 hours, ears start to pain and becomes uncomfortable.Pro's1. Best fit, it will not fall out.2. HD sound at approx 70 percent volume.3. Mic is good not the best. Manageable at this price range4. Noise cancellation good blocks 90 percent of the backround noise.Overall best in its price range. Don't expect much, you see it's not a Bose."
"Okay, some people may differ but in my opinion the bass is too much. So much that it overpowers all the other aspects of the song. If you're into EDM where it's basically bass and.... just bass, then I guess it's a good fit. But if you want to hear other genre of music, then I would advise not to buy this product. The bass is just painful and I had to return the product and buy Sennheiser CX180 instead. It's too good for the price range."
"My second Boat earphone is also stop working within three months. What is this, and there is no response from your side regarding my first earphone replacement from many days (ticket no. 1154217)You guys are not responsing about my complain, is this way to deal with your costumers. Your call center is not picking up call. You give warranty of your product and when I claim for warranty you stop responding me. I bought two earphones and both are not working.  bad product.... After three months of use it will show different types problems.. And there is no response from company when you go for warranty. I have two same earphones and within 3 months both are not working."
It is used for 8 months one side does not working now I applied for the warranty and take the product but now the boat has not replied to my email and calls @boat I very disappointed by the boat company.Very very worst response from the boat they replaced my headphones after 2 months and they send green colour but my headphones colour is black and they send without any box and rubbers (ear buds) very very bad response don't buy any boat accessories the warranty they told is fake.
Warranty of this product is not useful after buying this product 3-4 months later in one side and Mic not working after dead I made in warranty ticket then they picked off from my phone and deliver to the Mumbai head head office of boat service centre and then while I checking the status of my ticket then it is written that replacement product issued now it's been one month over and I didn't get my product so their service is very bad don't buy these products otherwise the product quality is very good but their service is very very poor
"Till now I never reviewed any negatives about the product.But this one is very worst product made by boat.sound quality is like 50/-rs street shop earphones .High sounds are like gun firing,bgm,etc is like watching movies on Kaarbon 2000r phone speakersThis is worstFrom past 3years am buying boat earphone and headphones all that was worth for more than that price But this 242 is not even worth for 50rsI don't know whether it's boat product or clone product"
"The overall sound quality is good, this is a good sports earphone for the price, but you get another earphone that's far superior than these, at the same price. They are called Leaf Bolt.Leaf Bolt's sound quality and bass is far superior than Boat Bassheads 242. And I have worn them in showering rain multiple times and they have remained absolutely fine due to their water resistance tech. Go for Leaf Bolt instead if you want overall better experience and comfort as well. Or go for Realme Buds 2 or Boat Bassheads 225 if you are obsessed with earth shattering bass for this price range."
"Very flimsy! Not meant for runners, sports or even walking for that matter.The wiring inside the mic assembly where other buttons like volume controls are placed was shorting causing volume commands to be activated on slight movement of the cord around the mic module. Buy it if you still want to experiment and don't mind loosing your money. Keep the packaging for at least till the return window in case you buy it."
"The headphone are of very good quality but the service is WORST!!! I faced the typical boat issue of one side not working after 6months. I reached customer care and they had a pickup but it's been a month and there is no update. Whenever I try to call customer care it gets disconnected frequently and by chance if it gets connected then the executive doesn't cooperates and says the same thing that it would be dispatched tomorrow and this countinues for over 4 weeks now. Have had this experience previously with bassheads225 but still I chosed to buy boat product again. But not making the same mistake again. If you wanna buy boat products consider buying a newer one again after 6 months, coz this is validity of there products."
"I was confused whether I should return or not.  I have done the sound test on this boat earphone and I compared with JBL. I tried to see the difference in the same music.  I am going to do sound test on Vivo earphones.  I tried to use both earphones on vivo s1 phone.Pros (why you should buy)1. Good bass(bass lover should like it)2. Awesome wire quality.  Tangle free, durable and beautiful.3. 1 year warranty4.You can remove the sports cap if you are not using for sportsCons(not to buy)1. Treble is 0. No treble.  Bass treble should have balance.  Sound quality decreased.  It looks someone is pressing the neck of the singer.2. There is no surround sound.  The earphones with surround sound gives pleasure.  The left music should play in left earphone and right in right earphone. It is lacking.3.if boat Will work on above two points.  This earphon will be awesome.4. The earphone is not comfortable for long time music.  You have to remove the cap.  The boat should release half earphones like apple and vivo. The earphone is comfort after removing cap."

 Sound quality 5/5Noise cancellation 4/5Bass quality 4.5 / 5Best headphones in this budget.Long lasting.I am ordering this headphone 2 nd time. my 1st headphones lasted for 2 years with 3-4 hours daily usage for office calls.It’s tangle free only problem is dust is accumulated on it over the period of 2 years and you need to clean it occasionally.I have ordered blue colour and look wise it’s very vibrant and beautiful.
It works properly for just 3 months after it bacames worst than any thing else after claiming my warranty it took to clear 1 month. Even after I got some others used earphone which is also not working. I'm fed up with this earphone now I'm using just for listening songs it isn't working in any call. So while purchasing read review.
"Looking at lot of good reviews, I think the opinion probably differs with people.. Sound quality is definitely better than any low profile earphones, but bass quality seems to be so unnatural, boosted to much that gives pain in the ears.Pros: Ear piece stick to the ear comfortably, Sound quality is decent enough, call quality is goodCons: Boosted bass sound spoils the original music (some may like it) it hurts the ear drum in short time of listening to the songs. `This is the first day review, if my opinion change after some days of usage, will get back to change the rating."

 I bought this product in blue color while it suddenly stopped working after few months and I decided to send it to customer service where I came to know whatever they mention on their website is nothing true nobody comes pick up ghe product ans replace u have to go to the service center crowded with lots of people where they just asked me to fill a form and without even checking the issue just gave me another product which was kept in plastic they asked me to check and take it. I was satisfied but just in few days this replaced product started falling apart. Rubbish now I have to go again and wait for 2 hours to get this solved
"Great earphone, I purchased in ₹549, though currently it is available in ₹499 . Little disappointed.Sound is amazing, cable is not that great, there are 3 buttons available. It is better than mi basic earphone that comes in 399/-You can go for it without any doubt.Edit :-After 7 months of use suddenly it's mic has stopped working and in single attempt it doesn't connect with phone and I have to unplug and plug again to connect with phone. Mic and the buttons stopped working and this is the biggest issue with these earphone. Although sound output is still good. Just after warranty expires its mic stopped working, thats ridiculous with Boat.It also don't have L shaped connector like mi basic earphone, so it's not comfortable while Playing games and connecting to laptop."
"On the 7th day the callers voice started cracking, thought it was network issue but later found it was same condition. 9th day caller n me couldn't hear each other. couldn't return/exchange - window closed. Warranty centre closed, no reply from the email id sent to imagine marketing India ."
"Here are some pros nd consBass quality goodQuality wise is bestNoice cancellation not so goodI think little bit pricy because i got for 550RSAfter usage of 2 month it was not working from one sideNd this problem happened with 2 of my same product (Boat bassheads 242)After that i call Amazon customer care after 10-15 minutes wait they pic up the call nd told me that I wasn't able to helped you .Firstly you should call on Boat customer care number nd here i call them again after 10 minutes they picked up the call they told me file a complaint against the product nd then we pic up your product nd then it goes to our department house where we are checking what's is the problem nd then we ship your productThis process complete around 18-20 daysIt's make me anxious , whatever i go with them  , let's see what happenThink twice before investing your money 💰"

" I bought this in October 2020 and writing the review in September 2021. Nearly 1 year of rough use. The sound quality is very good. Amazing noise cancellation. Fits snuggly in my ears. Since it's orange, I can find it when I forget where I kept them. But slowly wear and tears appeared. I have kept it working with cellotapes. Is it worth the money when it can fall apart with some rough use? Or are we supposed to use our earphones delicately?Anyway, I recommend it to music lovers. Others can try something cheaper."
"Purchased at 399.Absolutely beast at this price range, and it perform even better with Dolby Atmos. Sound is very loud, bass is just what Indians likes. I normally listen it on 70% to 80% Sound. They are very comfortable to wear the wings don't let the earpiece fall.I have used Sony MDR XB55AP its sound is comparable to this Boat handsfree. I mean Punchy Bass and loud noise. I have Used a range of handsfree from Samsung AKG, Senheizer, Noise, Sony, Motorola, JBL & Philips. In all of these the Bass was main concern except the Sony one and none of them come at this price range.So if you are looking for a cheap handsfree with powerful Bass, punchy sound, crystal clear Voice with noise cancelation, mic and also multi function button with Volume rocker. I would say Go for it.It works with all smartphone that support 3.5mm jack and yes It has zero lag for Game sound like PUBG and COD. So it's also good for playing Battle Royal Games."
"Mids r sharp, painful in ear, not clear vocals and treble. Bass good not best. Plastic used cheap quality. The ear fitting and design very bad for ear. Wire is one side in bud so that it pain ear. Very sharp and thin treble audio and bass is not matching. Very unfit and painful for ear cheap plastic quality design. Artis 400m is much better than this atleas clear vocals and 15mm driver. Money vaste product. Everyone who giving it 5 star even don't know about audio technologies."
"Product is good. Sound is good. In short this is nice product. But as u now can see on the pictures this happened with me with this product. One side of earplug is automatically came out from its wire. & This is soo heartbroken.So all I want Plz replace this product, so I can enjoy my music. I am your regular customer.Hoping & waiting for a positive response from Amazon/boat India.Thanks"
"My review after 10 days of heavy usage, and I'm comparing it with my previous Realme buds 2.1. sound quality, its good not that bad, but when my friend heard music from my earphones he commented "" Such a Bad Bass "".And even i think it doesn't have good bass2nd Noice Cancellations, uhm maybe it's better than Realme buds 2 in my opinion3rd build quality, I literally liked its build quality, I mean uhm.. I guess wires are really durable and I hope it lasts for a longer than Realme buds 2, my Realme buds 2 lasted for more than a year and was damaged from the button area, wires got damaged and maybe it's because I keep them in my pocket all the time, which reminds me of4. Dude ! The only reason why I really hate these earphones are  its Really, Really, Really Very Uncomfortable even after 10 days, my ears are still Paining... I was thinking about removing the rubber thing but I usually go for running so I need thatAnd it get tangled a lot ( I keep them in my pockets ).The only Reason why I bought this is because 1 year warranty, but honestly I'm regretting I should have really gone for Realme buds 2 they were awesome, Comfortable, good sound quality ( not excellent obviously, but better than these earphone ), and because of those magnetic tips it used to get tangled very Rarely,.If anyone reading this review, wondering about should you buy it or not then... Uhmm... Honestly give Realme buds 2 a try or even if you are purchasing it I hope it doesn't hurt your ear, anyways Good Luck !"
"It is one of the worst headphones I have ever used in my whole life. I wanted to get one for my calls and some light music and unfortunately fell for the reviews on this product which are a gimmick BTW. The product build quality is quite cheap, worse than those cheap Chinese headphones. They are not at all comfortable for long or even short use because once you put them, it hurts your ears. I had to end up buying another pair of headphones to get rid of these cheap and horrible product. If you are looking for comfort, better music experience for long hours, better go for headphones which are having in ear buds similar to the shape of old Apple earphones. Such in ear headphones which blocks air passing to your ear are neither healthy not comfortable."
"The sound quality is just too pathetic.Cons:On call, we or the other person gets to hear echoSound quality seems like a sasta road-side product...too sharp unbearable notes can be heard while listening to online courses or music.The design is just so bad that it causes ear cartilage pain only after listening to 30 mins.Pros:Lookwise is good (but it no where covers up the above nuances)The seller is good. He gave me replace hassle free...but the replacement ear phones STILL has all the above issues. Only the echo issue has somewhat reduced."
"I ordered this earphone keeping in view of the reviews. But within one day use, I found that this earphone can harm my ear. Some heating is experienced in both the ears, resulting pain. Found not suitable for regular music lovers. The sound quality,bass quality are not soothing to the ears. So want to replace it with other brand. But replacement with other brand is not available. What to do now. I wasted my 550/- rupees."
242 is not up to the mark. I already have Bass head 100 which is better than this one. Noice cancellation is not that much great. Only benefit I found is that it has inline mic with volume control.Good in bassTreble is above average but actually I found it a disturbing one compared to bass head 100.Fits in ear with ear clip.The additional clip for dress is also helpful.Good cord length and material is also good.Product wise it need improvement.Delivery and packing is fine.Thank you amazon
the photo i attached is not my earphone!!! boat is worst company i ever see!!! here the story ↓↓↓i purchased this an earphone 2 months back for 550 bucks !! sound was not good mic is also not good just avrg!! but i was still using that earphone!! but after 1.5 months later it stops working! i claim for warranty!! i got my replacement in 20dayss.. that a big numbers but i bought another earphone in between this period cuz 20 day without earphone is difficult anyways!! i got my replacement today!! and earphone i got is not my not new its someone used earphone without rubber bud!!n i dont use second hand product!!! and the package is cheap!! seriously boat just spend money on there sponser not there costomers!!!
"Sound quality is good,  bass quality is good too. Lookwise it is stylish and amazing. But this product is not DURABLE.Got it delivered on 30th september and it's hardly 2 months passed that it has stopped working yesterday. Till now I have purchased 5 Nos. of boat earphones. But I am unhappy with the last two purchases. Same issues with the previous one too,  stop working too soon.Initially, for me they use to be the best- better in quality as well as price but not anymore. Varients have increased with time but the quality didn't. Will not recommend anymore."
"If you want the best earphones in the price range of 500, go for this one for sure. The bass and the treble are amazing and you can feel it. Also the earclips provided fit and wont come off. Its like they juat glue to your ears and will never come off, unless you remove them. Fits perfectly.Cons- The build quality. It has a cheap Chinese plastic finish on it. My brother had the other black with red on the boat logo. It looked cheap and very bad. But for 399, what can you expect.So my recommendation would be to buy the carbon black one, as it looks much more better and more luxurious. But the price is 549, for the same earphones, of different colours. You get a metallic finish in this one, but you can spot out the plastic easily.Will keep on updating every month till one year, cause boat products last only one year and after that you have to buy a new one."
"I brought Boat 242 earphones last week.. Just in a week Right side speaker of earhone stopped working.. I tried to calling to centre, but number is not reachable.. Later i raised a ticket in their warrty claiming website.. Ticket got generated but no one has turned back to me.. Only the on package and specifications it is mentioned as one year warranty in reality no warranty.. If something goes wrong then it is yur mistake.. Im unable to understand wat has to be done to replace the product.. Amazon is also not taking it back.. Please if someone know solution for this please let me know..Product is pretty cool but Very very bad service."
"It's a great product considering its price. Good built quality, Sounds is clear and amazing deep bass.Unfortunately the right side stopped working after 2mnths. I have written to info@imaginemarketingindia.com but didn't get any response. Very disappointed :("
"It was just an Awesome sets of earphone with accurate frequency point to listen a song ... Just replacing the ear caps, change the tune & frequency for the listener ...In small pair of ear caps you can hear pure Crystal Clear voice & only it focus on voiceIn medium pair of ear caps u get a sense of Equalize bass, drums, voice (as per song u have/make)In large if it will fit in your ear it will give u complete sense of isolation of song like an large hallIt work like as per a high-Quality headset become sounds as per there change of Padss Cusans ... It's awesome to have it ... Try it u goonna make sure it sense something else in every different ear pads"
"I bought this product in April 2021. Intially, it worked well but right after 3rd week it started malfunction. The volume from my phone started increasing and decreasing by itself when I moved the wire of the earphone. Also, it stopped working after 2 months. I filed a complaint to boat, they exchanged it with the same orange earphone. The new one did the same, followed the same pattern for two months then stopped working. I exchange again and same thing happened again. This time, I am exchanging the product for the 5th time and I am kind of sure it will be repeated this time too.I think the problem is only in this orange variant because I have the same earphone model in green colour and it works well.  BTW, on my experience boat products in general do not last more than 6 months. I would recommend you to choose a different brand and if you buy this product atleast do not choose orange colour."
"Update : stopped working after 1.4  years .. even after utmost care ..I've only used this earphones indoors and never took them out of my house now I've ever tangled it .. still it stopped working ..Writing this after 6 months of usage... Straight to the point I'd like to say isPreviously I was using mi earphones compared to that , these one have very low bass, if you're a bass lover then don't go for it, but boat bassheads 242 has a crisp and clear audio .. the quality of audio is really clearer but there's very little bass and high amount of treble.. you can see even after 6 months of usage the quality of earphone are as it was when I purchased, build quality is really really amazing.. loved it 🙌🙌"
Very bad product . Sound clarity is too bad. Just some bass only. Never buy from amazon. If you happen to have a return then they wouldn’t refund you back.
This is my review after using a month.Pros:- Easy fit- Good sound- Pretty good Noise cancellation- Provided a small clip to pin the wire to your shirt.Cons:- Can hear non stop for 40 minutes or a hour. then you can get slightly feel the pain. pain is good becasue it will notify to take rest for sometime :)Even though seller mentioned it is waterproof. but still i'm taking care of it by staying away from water and wiping the sweat often.You should buy it without second thought... Happy Purchase!
"Just got this after 1 day ( 1-01-2021), and i can say the quality of the earbuds isn't that great because it feels super plasticky, sound quality on the other hand is one of the best I've heard in this price, i also use realme buds2 and the sound is clearly better and clearer in this one, i listen to loads of EDM so this is on the same level or better than RealMe buds 2 in the bass department.Also the earplugs for extra fitting can be removed, i personally find them irritating so thank god for that, so far so good & will update in the future (Update 8-06-2021, left earpiece has stopped working, i never used it harshly but still it stopped working, it's been happening with every earphone i buy, max use time is 5-7 months)"
"The Mic of this headphone did not work when I checked it wasn't returnable, when I went to claim warranty they asked me to come in the morning.In morning they said they don't have stock!  Visited 4 times to service centre in 4 months and i am still stuck with faulty headphones. Please avoid they are here to dupe you, their conduct at the service centre was exactly that. ( the service centre is in Mumbai )"
"For the price it is definitely a steal. It is light weight and easy to carry around. The color and design is also quite nice. The bass is exceptionally good.However on the flip side there's a bit of static that is very faint at times when you plug it to your phone. Songs that have bass notes sound amazing but any song that doesn't have a heavy bass, sounds pretty off, making the listening experience unpleasant. Songs that have a stronger degree  of treble will sound shrill in your ear. Nonetheless, for the price it is a good bargain."
"Bough this and replaced it once, both times the jack was faulty. It rapidly detoriated within 10days of light usage(only at night fr an hour or so) to the point that it used to ring in one side only in most positions of the jack(started with rarely being so, n within 10days became like this). Replacement had the same story. Before this i used to own a boat 225/220 and worked for 2yrs before one side gave out. Returnd the replacement and bought boat bassheads 225/220 and it works perfectly like before.DO NOT WASTE TIME ON THIS MODEL!Go for boat bassheads 220/225(amazon n flipkart show differebt number for same model) its much better in sound quality, material n durability."
I received a defective product.Headphones jack cover was easily removable.I had attached it with my mobile and later on when tried to take it out cover was coming out.Images are the proofIf brand new headphones have such quality then how will we trust on Boat as brand.I have got Boat Avante 1160 speakerBoat bass head 800 over the ear headphones buy they are good. No problem with them.Realme buds 2 are better than Boat basshead 242 at price of 599 and have magnetic attachment for headphonesHowever whenever I buy a headphone with cable it also have low sound quality or it comes damaged to me.Earlier as well I have returned another headphone which got good reviews from other people who have bought it however it is not the same case with me.Kindly refund the amount so that I can go for other brand.Cable quality is good but final product doesn't seem to have gone from proper checking.Bass is not that good if compared with Realme buds 2
The built quality is too bad. Cheap plastic quality. Sound quality is decent and above average. I got this for Rs 399 during lightning deal but definitely not a Rs 450 or above product for the quality of plastic used.
"I don't know why everyone is hating this product.  In my opinion it's details are as follows-Pros- 1. It comes with hook that is very good to manage earphone.2. Earphone pouch is pretty decent.3. Earphone fits perfectly in ear without any chance of dropping.4. Sound quality is very good, It's not for very high bass lover, for in my opinion sound is perfectly tuned with treble and bass.5. Ear tips are very comfirtable.Cons- 1. Product quality at this price range is worse. I mean wire quality is very cheap. If you are using it very roughly then it will not last long. REALME BUDS 2 are better then it.2. For bass lover, plz go for REALME BUDS 2, which is best product under 1000.3. There is no noise cancellation, which is not even available in other earphones. So it is not a big issue.That's it. I used almost all earphone. But this is good enough and real me buds 2 is best product to buy."
Sound quality is ear deafening... u can use it with 70-80% more than that u cant ..or u r crazy ...BASS 5/5I feel the price is affordable.5/5The wire are very durable 5/5(Wires with nylon outer cover as of i know )the buttons 5/5I use it as a daily driver in gymit wont come unless u take it out.Cons: After using it for 60-70 minutes you will feel slight discomfort due to the ear wing and also you feel discomfort whiling using it in while on a pillow in bed.( the ear hooks are detachable) it gives more comfort.but it is the best wired headset in the range and it is better than their own 225 headphones...i highly recommend it for people who need A good bass headphones
"Bassheads are pretty good at comfort and style💖... It has got a really crispy sound🔊... Ear budds are usefull and clip as well... Perfect for jogging and morning fitness...I found a small demerit--it's mic is a bit unsatisfying, the recording sounds need to be little more clear... When we do phone calls the person on the other line feels some discomfort in hearing our voice...After all.. boAt have made a nice piece of sound... Well done boAt and amazon👍🏼👍🏼💖💖"
"I have purchased the product after reading the review but sorry to say this product has not at allnfull filled my expectaion at all if i compair it from other priducts like jbl and other iternationl brands. The ear buds dosnot fullybenters in the ear so other sound can be hurd easily if onenis listening any mobile content. As an Indian company I will give 3 star rating. Qyality make 5*, wire jack, clip ,Mic 5star. Volume up and down 2 star only. Max volume 2star. Wire lenghth 3 star. This priduct does not desrev any 5 star ratings. A lot of videonreviews are avaialabale at youtube before purchasing it one must see those reviews at youtube."
"I'm telling you with my experience with more than 5 boat earphones, speakers. They compromise on build quality and R&D. Mesh in 3 of my earphones came out. They just use glue to stick which is cheap quality. Wire quality is poor. I understood that boat only focuses on advertising and selling multiple products instead of one good product. Mark this helpful if you think new buyers of boat should be aware of this."
"This earphone comes with great features and good quality. Wires are of good quality, nice bass quality, best in this price band of 399 INR, comes with the bonus feature of exclusive buttons for volume up - down rocker, play - pause music buttons. Sound quality is really good and volume level is sure high. Mic quality is not good at least in normal usage. Otherwise it is a value for money earphone.Update: Boat service is excellent. Once registered on their website, they pick up at doorstep and send replacement in 1-2 days to doorstep along with complete tracking info through message, mail and tracking link. Thanks to Boat for their great care and support!"
"In the first 4-5 months they will work perfectly and you think you cannot get such sound quality at this price. But after 6 months they started to give  a constant ""husss"" sound. After one more month it was unable to play some notes well (sound distorts while playing some notes).I have to emphasize here that the earphones were very well treated - no major bends etc in the wire - no wear on the product itself. But they will fail after 6-8 months.My previous boat earphones were boat bassheads 200 and some other bassheads in the rs500-600 category. Each of the product failed within 12 months - some failed earlier. My conclusion is that these guys spend money in tuning (Bass good) and celebrity promotions of their products compared to the actual quality of drivers which is the poorest. So after 3 failed products within the warranty I am not going to bother purchasing another boat product again."
"The wire feels robust but it is not tangle free. Some reasons sound was good but later I start hearing a sharp hissing sound like when you say 'this' you will hear thisssssssssss. Very sharp which actually hit me in my brain. I have noticed this in other Boat earphones as well. Secondly, you can't wear it for a long time. Your ear will start hurting by the earphone. Well, I'm going to waste this earphone because I can stand this hissssssssing sound.  This is my honestly, review and it is really upto you to decide what you want to buy."

" One side of ear phone not working as you can see . Also pack is properly sealed but headphone is cracked .I completely wasted my money on this product , also tried to replace this but they cancelled the replacement more than 2 times . customer care they were telling your problems will be resolved but still product not replaced and problems not resolved ."
"So today I got the replaced piece, from the one delivered first, there was a disturbance with movement of the wire, which also means that the earphones won't probably last too long. But the real problem was during calls, the people on the other end complained of a disturbing noise which keeps going on and off. Even with the new ones I got today, if I just rotate the 3.5 mm connector, I can hear some little disturbance which means I might face the same problem probably with these as well but I am not going through the pain of replacing these again, also to be fair I need to test these new ones a little more.The sound quality otherwise is decent, sound a bit too high I think, like 50% is good enough for me and 70-75% is too high and 100% is just not bearable for more than a second!As I said earlier, these are OK, you can buy these and you might be satisfied, but you can also look for other options in this price range."
After purchase with in 2 days the right side of earpiece stopped working then I replaced the product so please be aware not so good also mike quality is very bad. You can only replace the product with same earphones with in 7 days of purchase but no option of return.
"I was waited for the black and red version of it but i couldn't get that. So i have to stick with sprit lime.  Before gst hike this same product available at 400rs in offer period but it is only available at 499rs even at offer time.Pros1. Good looking2. It has volume button as well as play, pause button3. it has got 3 ear tips for your convenience.4. It also has clip and holder for ear5. It has ipx4 ratingCons1. The play pause button sometimes act as next button sometimes work as play pause confusing mechanism2. It holds perfect but i didn't use that white colour holder if you use that you may feel pain after long time.3. I have used it for gaming continuously for long time but i did gave any issue but i have used it for my online training for one day i had pain in my ears i don't know why.4. The price gets lower in atleast in offer time would be great ."

" One of the best product, have ever ordered for myselfFits perfectly in my ears,Clip holds the cable not to move around while working,Sound quality is too good.I have been using more than a month.Good brand with great product quality for reasonable price is rare combination. Just go for it👍"
I have I used other boat products and was a happy customer until now. The sound quality is not bad but most likely you will not have a strong connection because of the 3.5mm jack is so slim it tends to come out all the time never stays in place if you have phone back over which we are likely to have. Major flaw in their design don't know if it's cost cutting or some failure to implement sleek design but it makes my purchase useless. Disgrace
"I was glad to buy boat earphones supporting Made in India, but the product did not reached my expectationsThere are many cons like1. Rubber earsfit are not soft and is available only in large size. It does hurts for small eared people. Either discontinue giving them along or provide them in every size.2. Drivers are 10mm still bass is far beyond expectations, it does not have punchy base. Can produce pro level wave vibrations.Pros:1. Design is attractive and appealing Colors.2. Water resistant3. Built Quality is good and cables doesn't tangle.4. Carrying pouch is attractive.I suggest boat to remake them around 1k or near and provide good accessories and balance Treble and bass. It's competitors like Wooky, Infinity, JBL & Skullcandy are really heart winning.Boat Baseheads 225 are in a way awesome like other competatives but they are heavy so is avoided.I wish boat a great future ahead."
Quality is not up to the mark. Used with my moto one power as well as HP elitebook . Very uncomfortable noises . Sometimes hessy unwanted noises . Not very comfortable in fittings too.Now I need to buy boat 225 . I had it before and much better than this one .Only plus point is volume control and start stop option. This is working fine.I need to refund money and go for another product but only return option is available. I already returned one product but same problem in returned product.Bab buy.. I need refund of money and go for another boat product.
"Awesome earphones!Loved every bit of it except one which I will come on to.The ear buds are great quality plastic doesn't feel like its a sub 500 bucks earphone. The rubber tips are smooth and do not hurt the ears. Base quality is awesome being Boat. Wont go to technicalities, many have written about it.Put on the earphones, pump up the volume to say 60-70% and you are liberated from most of the noises around you including your mom or wife calling you! ;)It has a nice inline mic on right earphone wire and has volume control buttons too on it and all of it is very well built. No build quality complains as such. It is totally worth, very lightweight too on ears and keep wearing this and work/play games/listen to music/do light exercises and what not. They do not slip off with any of that, not sure with heavy workouts. Sweat proof protection too! Aur kya chahiye? batata hun ....Now coming to the one con -It has a straight jack and not a L shaped one. So if you have your headset jack in the bottom of your phone and want to keep the phone upright on your say belly and do facebook/twitter or any other similar app which calls for keeping phone upright then that will get uncomfortable and it straightway will effect the durability as the cable will snap sometime if not soon if you press it against your body and keep doing that.So for that, I am really disappointed with what could have been a real winner! If you have the headset jack at top of your phone - damn lucky you are, blindly go for this headset!!"
"Wasted 500 for this. I'd rather buy mi earphones worth 300 which at least last longer, have better qualuity and does the job.  Only after a few weeks, i don't like this. I don't think it is gonna last any longer. The mesh literally came out with hardly any force. Very bad quality. Even the ear cap where the brand logo is present came out easily. Had to use feviqwik to stick it. Overall very bad quality for its price. Expected better from boat. The sound quality was good. Noise cancellation was decent."
"Bass, amazing.Sound, really good.Looks, AMAZING.Probably one of my best buys after my Bluetooth earphones broke.One should alwaysss go for earphones by Boat, and esp these because they're literally hassle free (charging the bluetooth ones is a pain) and gives you a good feeling just by looking at it.Got them in blue and they're so pretty omg.For the sound quality, it's amazing too. It's been two weeks that I'm using it and there's no pain in the ear as such, claimed by other reviews.(Obviously one's got to have an earpain if you don't give your ears, a chance to breathe and stuff them with headphones/earphones for the most part of the day, right?)Don't have doubts and scones, just go for it."
It's around a month that I am using this product. Sound quality is extremely good. I was using realme buds2 before this for about 2 years. I think this is better than that as per the sound quality is concerned. Very clear sound. Though the wire from the mic to the earplugs are thin as compared to realme buds2 but they are reliable. The extra rubber make it very sturdy and keeps it fixed to the ears and are detachable too. So you can remove them if you want. I have read in some reviews that they cause pain to ears but it's not true. It is very comfortable. If you are thinking for purchasing this then don't give a second thought. Go for it. Would definitely recommend this.
"I know.. like all these wires and all can be messy but this one look really cool. I got this lime colour and it's more like neon green vibrant colour & I loved it at once. Earplugs are comfortable coz I am wearing them for an hour now and they don't hurt at all, sound is crisp and clear and bass in music just rocks(tried playing variants) .this has this clip,in that way the earplug wires won't be dangling and strangling. I like these volume controls along with the mic and both,  mic and controls works fine. This one is a stretch resistance and I can see why , and hope it tolerates my rough usage. It also comes with a small pouch were I can keep my earphone and make sure it travels safely with me everywhere.😊"
"The product is an above average one and an advantage to the fame of BOATPros:- It has great brand package- Stylish design and best quality wires that can withstand all kinds of wear and tear- Best class noise cancellation- Sound quality is brilliant and provides above average bass.Cons:- The length of the wire/ cord is too much, so some may feel it uncomfortable as I do- The bass quality is not of the best quality, but on enabling the Dolby Atmos mode on certain mobile phones, it gets to the best version- The buttons may get pressed inwards/ damaged fast, but currently in good conditionOn the whole, go for it. Nice value for money product."
"I've used a lot of earphones / head phones. Wired, Wireless.. Top brands like Senheisser, JBL, Samsung and Sony. I have even tried other wired in-ear earphones from boat. None of them are as reliable as this and the key factor here is comfort. Extremely comfortable and causes no pain."
"These boat bassheads are an absolute steal for this price.I mainly purchased it for the mic,as it's closer unlike many other earphones and it's fulfilled it's purpose.They have a sporty look and a plastic build.The audio quality is outstanding ,and this is by far the best earphones I've had till now.The bass is punchy and the mistimes are well balanced as well.The noise cancellation on this is unreal.They're great for my workouts and sweatproof.Call quality is great and I've had no complains so far.Overall very satisfied with my purchase.Its sporty look might not be for everyone but performance wise it's great."
"Heard alot about this product but actually not satisfied, I would not recommend this for song lover, product hardware quality is good it's durable but the actual work is listening to music which is not good at all, I will give 1/5 for sound quality and 4/5 for durability of product.Another surprising is no return policy. You can exchange but NO RETURN.So order it with cautious"
"For all those reading the review and scrolling through to find honest ones, I have had the most pathetic experience with the company, the earphones came in working condition but after a few days the mic stopped working and I visited the service centre to get a new one, after a few days even the replaced one stopped working and frustrated I wrote at info@imaginemarketingindia.com, they were good enough to arrange a pick up from my home location and drop off for the 2nd replacement but seems there is no one professional in the company to brief the customer that a pick has been arranged or even the delivery guy with the complete address of the customer. This ain't enough that even the 3rd earphone went bad ie mic stopped working, I again wrote a mail to at the same address and tried to find out email of the management, again there was a pick up arranged with no communication to me or the courier company about my detailed address which again wasted my and the courier guy's time. They have a customer care number which somehow doesn't connect to a representative. I have no clue, but nobody from the company even writing an email just shows how unprofessional they can be, and I bet seems spooky and eerie has hell that is it humans or ghosts running the company. To top it, they are a billion dollar plus company with some 500+ employees. HENCE IF YOU HAVE THE PATIENCE AND MENTAL STRENGTH TO DEAL WITH THE COMPANY FOR WARRANTY, GO AHEAD AND BUY THEIR PRODUCTS AT YOUR OWN RISK."
"In short, this is the lowest priced earphones with full bass and good quality sound. i bought this for general use and sometimes i use it in gym because it do not slip from ears. Better than Mi dual driver earphones.I bought it on March 2021 and still today, its performing very good without any problems.Movies and music experience is very good, its more than i expected. Buy it without worry."
"I recently bought a pair of these amazing  earphones. The product amazed me even before I got it. Firstly, it was delivered to me in less than a day which was too good. Once I received them I was very pleased with their quality. They are noise-cancellation enabled & also have an in-built mike. & to top it all, they come at a very pocket friendly price. To summarize, I am very happy with my purchase & highly recommend them to everyone looking out for a pair of earphones."
"I had bought Boat wired basshead 242 model. After purchasing of just one week, a disturbance noise sound started in headphone. After replacement of just three days, suddenly voice on  left side speaker stopped. I have never seen this kind of very cheap kwality product. Even wired headphone available in local market are much better than this. Please don't buy this product, otherwise u will only regret."
"Just go for the product.... everything is just amazing in this product...Sturdy packing ...👍🏻Looks.....🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥...it shines like a diamond Dude...(if you're a Gaming Geek like me, please select the NEON GREEN colour)It also has a volume rocker which is like an incentive for your salary 😅I am a BASS lover🤙🏻 and it didn't let me down.....a BEAST from ⛵....The 10 mm drivers are to the point 🤩Please try this product....before the stocks last....please believe me you won't regret it."
"Got the product delivered today. It's just an average earphone. The sound quality is good and also plugs into the ears just perfectly, thus cancelling outside sounds totally. The wire is quite long but is not tangle resistant. Gets tangled very easily. The multi function button works only for calls i.e to pick or cut calls and control call volume. It does not work while playing video or music (though it displays paly/pause symbol). But I got it for 449/- , so for this price I guess it's fine and serves my purpose. So not returning it. It also comes with 2 pairs of extra ear buds and a small carry pouch."

" Rate out of 5,  sound,4  bass,4Noise canceling, 2built quality, 5  mic quality,5pouch, so small ..all rouder boat 242 and only best sound in realme buds2 but built quality not good."
This product sound is good but product build quality is very poor. It's wire break after 3 month uses and it became useless .You have to buy new one .This is business and only business.They design product such a way that it break and user buy a new one .Recurrent purchase and become a multi-billion company . Earn billions of money and become sharks and invest in startup and become multi trillionare .There is no user benefits but a way to become trillionare.
"Amazon Packaging - Packaging was good, the package was not destroyed or daformed in anyways, package was water tight (I know as it was raining 🤔)....Coming to the product package, the colour I chose was the same as shown on preview, comes with a warranty card, manual, two pairs of extra buds (1 small, 1, big) and a sticker.I am using the product for 2 months now, no change in colour or any damage to the microphone wherever, well if it is used roughly, it won't last a year.... Used carefully, it would clearly last 2-4 yearsBass boost is a 4* as can't hear at 85+ volume, noice cancellation is a go, I use it for my classes for 5-6 hours a day straight and it feels good ...But, the ear adjust earpiece hurts after using 3 hours straight so I have to use the product without the earpiece, but it's good for a call or a movie....Totally Can't Complain as this is totally cheap and the best quality avilable till now...(Couldn't share picture because of a glitch)"
"I don't know if you are an audiophile or not but as far as I am concerned these are the one of the best high-quality stuff available online.though the sound is not as par as a 3k headphone, what do you expect in such a small price range?pros:* good fit perfect ear support* awesome colour* mic is also good* the jack is hard to pull as no ridges on it if hands are oilycons:* not tangle-free* dirt magnet* no velcro and case to keep safe* the pinch too big and ugly* lacks bass and the sound is high pitched"
"I use it daily and it is excellent in this price.Bass isn't that strong. Good thing I don't rely on bass that much, simple vocals are enough for me.Design is good just the jack should have been angled not straight. If not careful, it can get damaged.Ear buds are not comfortable when those circle decoration things are on. They are easily removable. Less decorative then I guess.It came with a pouch and not a bad one."
"1.Sound quality good, don't expect thumping sound of 10driver headphone.2. Fits excellent and also comfortable enough in the ears.3. Stay relaxed even if you're sweating, don't expect fighting rainfall.4. Looks good but not really tangle free.5. Noise cancellation decent but not great, though can't expect much in this price.6. Overall satisfactory."
"I am disappointed. I recieved earphones with a malfunction. The sound quality is very good, crisp and clear. The mic is working fine. The bass is decent but not as good as I thought after reading the reviews. The malfunction is in the 3D sound. The sound that should come from left earphone come from right earphone and the sound that should come from right earphone comes from left side. You can notice this only if you play BattleGrounds Mobile India using the earphones. If you want to check your earphones then search on Youtube- ""footesteps in Pubg"" the first video of Gaming with Leo channel can help you checking this error. I played it for many days first I thought the problem is in the game but that's not the case. My earphones are faulty. I claimed warranty by calling a number given on the warranty card to activate warranty. Then I registered a complaint them on mail as (e-mail mentioned on warranty card as well as contact no. And website to register complaint). It is my first earphone purchase from boat company and I am disappointed. I am regretting why I skipped buying realme buds 2 just to save some money. Now I am waiting for replacement and they say it may take maximum 20 days to complete the replacement procedure and that too after they check my earphones that if it's faulty or not."

 I orderd them on june 11 and now its jan 10 they started making the noise .its base not working smoothly .So i can say they are valid upto 6 months only.choose wisely decision is yours .But im going to buy them again coz i loved them seriously they are far bettr thn the others.Hopefully you will find it helpful .Thankyou😄❤
"Good quality, bass, treble, volume, noise cancellation ( not sure about noice cancellation while on road but I think you can still go for it if you want to use high volume, it does it's job) I don't use earphone while talking so I can't review on it. Doesn't tangle (a plus point on that). Clear sound with a good amount of bass. I'm satisfied with this product."
After using it for a month or two.. Let me figure this out for you1) Sound quality upto the mark2) Bass is balanced which i prefer neither too much or less3) Built quality and the extraa layering over the wire makes it more reliable.4) Unconventional plugs makes it glew to the ear drums pretty well.5) Comes with a warranty6) Price range is perfect for a colored headphones like these.The only thing they can do better is with the microphone and volume balance. sometimes its too low or too high but hey it could be a case with the phone I am using.
"this was my first boat earphones after a lot of research/reviews.... every headphone brand has their own signature sound. Personally I like signature sound of philips. Although, I'd not tried many earphones but i found these boat 242 bassheads are unnecessarily noisy, again it's my personal point of view, as I like quality voice with good bass, but in these earphones I found vocals are distorting and getting  worse after 50% of volume. It becomes very irritating to ears & for bass lovers who want to hear boom boom more, these earphones are bassy but distorting & loud vocals make it worse experience. I think boat tried to satisfy critics after bassheads 225 by exploring other aspects of music other than bass in this price range but I personally didn't liked it, unnecessarily loud. I am giving it 2 stars just for bass & points deducted as bass is overlapped by distorting, irritating treble."
boat has always been one of the great companies which provide headphones are earphones in a reasonable price with good sound quality and this product also has not been disappointing I have been using both since quite a lot of time now I have brought a lot of products from boat and never have been disappointed by the products and the sound quality the base  the build the quality alway always better and superb you can try if your searching for a limited range good sound quality earphone
"Boat has personally been my Favourite Company for Buying Gadgets & Accessories. My trust on this Brand is immense and I have most of my Electronic Gadgets & Accessories from Boat.So, comes this Earphone which I have bought it for the Second Time without even Browsing other Options from other Brands. The first one got misplaced in a Trip 😥😥😥Boat 242 Earphones Features:1. It has all the Basic Features that a Earphone needs - Volume Control Buttons & Call Pick-up & End / Play-Pause Button2. Perfect Length of the Wire, Snap Clip to attach it to your Top Wear3. Extremely Soft & Movable Ear Security Fit which keeps the Earphones Perfectly Fixed in the Ear without the worry of it falling off from the ears4. You get 3 Pairs of Differently Sized Removable Ear Plugs which you can use for the Best Fit for your Ear Holes / Ear Drums5. A Super Cute Security Drawstring Travel Pouch to Roll in the Earphone and keep it Safe within your Bags or CupboardsTotally in love with this product and a must buy product 😍😍😍"
"This headphones are best in this price ,good sound quality, noise cancellation, good grip on ear while exercising but it might have some flaws like you have to put mic very near to lips then it's sound deliver perfectly on other side , sound quality is good but too best compare to high brand headphones.Overall go for it. It just have mic isse and little sound delivery."
"Earphones look good.Sound is good. Mic is good.Bass is not good, listen to a normal bass song (not bass boosted ones), it has less bass. I compared it with Sony MDR Ex155AP and felt day and night difference. So did not enjoy music in this headphone. Music is more on treble side.Bottom-line:- if you love bass, this is not the earphone."
"Now I can review this boAt Bassheads 242 in-Ear Wired Earphones with Mic. because I have been using it since last year, now I completed one year of my experience with this earphonethere are 10mm divers in this earphone which creates heavy bass.and the bass of this earphone is such a great of this segmentbut the vocal is good but not so clear as it should be.and if we are talking about it treble is better than other earphones in this price segment.Now let's talk about the pros and cons of this earphonepros1 this wire quality is so good because it has tangle free cable2 the mic quality is better for calling than the other earphone3 there is a volume controller on the right side of the earbuds4 this earphone has a wire clip inside the box carry pouch as well5 sound quality, the sound quality is not bad, it has a good quality sound experiencecons1  I couldn't find any cons of this earphone"
Sound quality: 5/5....this is the best sound an earphone can provide u in this price range...the best...from the amount of bass to the clarity of audio...its perfect in all terms.Comfort: 4.5/5...tho the hooks are provided for extra grip but they irritate my ears and dont fjt properly...idk if its just me but i didnt find the design very comfortable...also the earpieces are soo light in weight...maybe its a plus point for y'all but i didnt like them so light in weight.
"I've bought multiple earphone from bought and these are the first ones to disappoint me. My primary use for them was to use it as a media player for music which it does so I haven't returned it.On the other hand, it does not play or pick up on audio when I receive calls, I have to manually remove the earphones to hear the other person. I don't know if it's my piece tahts faulty or this model has this feature. Either way, it's a terrible receiver when it comes to calls."
"Very good sound for priceEarHooks are soft and fits/ feels nice and can be detachedEarphone tips are angled..so right earphone fits right ear and...Volume control works fineLastly/ Sadly, Non-braided cable so it feels kinda flimsy and not so durable always knotting so always need untying before useIf you looking for quality earphones costing less that Rs500; just go for Boat."
"Build quality was ok. Initially bass was okish. But after audio tuning it felt great. Buttons functioning were gud. Might feel pain in ears if using for long tym due to ""secure ear lock"" not coz of ear piece.Absence of Gold coated Jack felt a bit down.Overall, a totally value for money product at such price point and a real steal deal offer ;-)"
"the material quality of the headphone is good one . the MIC works well . And this headphone is best suits to the people who loves bass music . and it is good for gaming too. but the audio quality is quite depressing . very different experience from the ear phone I used before .This is the. Review what Iam writing after four months ( below) .The left side of the earphone stops working  , I don't know why . So if you are using this earphone . Handle with care  , it might stop working one day ."
"I am very disappointed. Volume button doesn't work.I am exchange the product 2times.but the volume button doesn't work in all the earphones🤯🤯.ear hooks is bent.it is waste.it is made by rubber.so it is flexible, it doesn't fix in ears.sound quality is good.that is reason for my 3 stars.don't buy this earphone."
"I didnt personally like it sound quality, mids and lows and even bass is very much average. Tried it for music, movies but not satisfactory on pubg the performace is way too bad as the noise is too high. I was using an mi headphones and they where far better than these. Not at all good for long users...  This is my realistic review after about 2 months of usage"
"It is a good earphone, fits in ear perfectly, a little big, but I don't know why people says it is better than realms buds 2. The sound is way much better in buds 2 . Buds 2 sound has much more bass feels much alive than this boat basshead 242. I suggest you to to buy buds 2 anytime over this. Realms buds 2 has no competition in this price range. But if you want an earphone while doing exercises and running buy this boat basshead 242 . It is sweatproof and doesn't fall of from your ear easily ."
"It's below average product. Bass quality is not good. Sound cracks at high volume. Almost little or No noise cancellation. And the most irritating thing is the cord, which gets tangled and has an unusual elastic property...You can't straighten the cord. It will automatically comes back...Like a spring. Mic is average. Sometimes couldn't hear the other person during call. Overall below average chinese made product."
"Please dont buy this product. To know why just read the review :-I purchased this on 21st December 2020 and it stopped working Today on 12th May 2021. Within 5 months, one side of the earphone stopped working without any damage. Edit - Today on 25th the second side also stopped working. I am trying to contact Boat and Amazon for help but their is a lot of delay in the name of Lockdown. Boat is not ever considering this issue because they are not replying my mails, calls or anything. Amazon will not help you much on this like befor, I don't know why. One more thing - the colour starts going away in few days of use. It may look old or low quality product in a months or 2."
I have used boat 400 earphone and it was awesome. This one may be stylish but its waste of money. Left side stopped working within a month with minimal use. No near by boat centre to replace or repair. I bought 2 similar headphone and both ended up being useless within a month. Prefer other item of boat not this.
Received original product. Audio quality is nice but it doesn't have much noise cancellation. Within 6 months the mike and the jack part of the earphone stopped working but it was under warranty so I sent it back for repair and they took 1 month for it so I have to buy another pair  . I received the repaired earphones and they are working fine now but 1 month for repair is really long time. Please vote'helpful review'if it helped you.
"At first, I was sceptical about these earphones because these are very low cost for the features they offer. I was doubtful that the sound output might not be that great out of these earphones. But suprisingly these are exceptional earphones because of the fact that these have great sound output with features like splash resistant, have great noise cancellation, multimedia control buttons, mic, Nylon coated cables, and very reasonable price tag.Compared to the expensive rival brands like JBL and Sennheiser, these offer more value.I bought these mainly to be used for workout sessions but now these are my primary earphones for all types of media consumption. Sound output like Highs (treble) and Mids (voice) are very well balanced and has punchy low end (bass).Although at start one may feel that these earphones are a bit uncomfortable during long hours but with time one will get used to them easily.The only down side I feel about these earphones is that they have cheaper plastic feel to it. But considering the pricing you can not expect more. Although the plastic is sturdy enough if you use them carefully."
I am a very old fan of boat. I have almost 7/8 earphones including headphones as well from boat. Some I used for myself some I gifted to family members. But we are a Boat family now.Ita worth buying. Best sound quality. Just sometimes person on the other side hears less voice of yours during call using microphone. Elee it's great all time. Would recommend you to go for it.
I bought it to gift my friend paying extra for colour black and within a one month it stopped working such a such a worst brand it's just overrated make in India k naam pe they are fooling people...isse zada din to footpath pr se liya huwa earphones chalta h it's just bakwas faltu bekar don't buy it
Support given with it for fixing in ear is extremely painful in ear. Ear start paining after 10 to 15 minutes. So you cannot wear it for long time. This is major major draw back.  Thank god I am using it only while working on PC. Please don't buy it if you want to wear it for long time.Two Stars is given just for packing. Packaging is good. But highly disappointed.
"You must try. So the packing and delivery was good . Other then this the product is awesome as per budget . I bought one earphone with gurantee but the wire torned and automatically seprated from the buds . And only 2 months I think I have used that and the cost was 300. Then I bought this and either it's not long time but it's very handy, soft wire, good sound and speakers hold and mic is also good . I am not very Cary for earphones and also I bought this kind of buds first time and I am completely satisfied ."
I am no techi. But for normal people looking for a wired headset . This is a good one.Packing was good.Sealed pack.Headset was good .Better sound quality compared to normal headset.Noise cancellation wad better.Wires are not as delicate as normal headset.  Definitely better quality.  Clip is provided so can be fixed to shirt  . Mike is at proper position and clear .Willl review later regarding its life and quality .Worth th price ( Got it for around Rs.500) .
"It says it is designed for fitness enthusiasts and water resistant but I feel it's just a marketing strategy.I used it only ones while running and the next moment it stopped working.Worst part is the customer service. I went to Borivali center with the product, forget about the solution they didn't even register my complaint. They asked me to come back whenever the product is available. And its been months now they don't have product available and the solution according to them is to visit another service center which is in very far from my place.In short it's customer who have to suffer for the worst customer service and for buying such disgusting Brand product."
"Amazing Fit which I will rate as 9 out of 10 and Amazing Sound Quality of 9.9 out of 10 because there is always a scope for improvement in the sound quality. The bass is just fine and not overused which is a very good point but it might be deal breaker for some. The Button Functions are not so cool as they appear but they work just as fine, Mic is perfect and the extra earbuds provides a wide ranging satisfying experience as per your use and fit.Overall a decent and stylish product with  addons of a fine quality carry  pouch and a clip of satisfying material. You will love this product."
After use of 1 month....-Initially the sound is soooo amazing... You gonna love the earphones but after use of few days bass starts fading (don't know the appropriate word)- starting few days it gives you clear sound with clear bass but after a month or 2 months... It start giving you noisy sound.How i compare?I bought 2 products 1 from Amazon and 1 from boat website and after a month i open the brand new package i ordered from boat and anyone can feel the difference.So this product is good but not durable.
"The High and Mids (Treble) are crystal clear. Lyrics can be distinguished. The lows(bass) are not that thumpy as they should be. Even with an equalizer the bass is not crispy, you can just feel a little not enjoy. Bass:- 3/5Overall:- Affordable at 449, comes with extra buds, wires look durable(will update after month use), volume button works well"
"I've been using these earphones for 4 months now and these are working pretty well. It has built in alexa which is a great feature and works perfectly fine. Boat never disappoints its customers when it comes to quality and since I'm a regular user that's why I can say this. But I've faced issues with wireless earphones from Boat (they get disconnected in between). I got them for ₹449 and i guess that's the min price they offer.Build quality ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Sound quality ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Alexa⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Easy to carry⭐⭐⭐⭐Noise cancellation ⭐⭐⭐Case is a bit small, so it's difficult to keep them inside easliy⭐⭐Overall at the price of ₹449 ⭐⭐⭐⭐Hope this helps ! ✅"
"After years of using earphones from other brands (which always costed me more), I came across and bought this pair from boat. Special thanks to Amazon for quick delivery.I got the earphones for INR 499, and am quite pleasantly surprised and delighted by the set of features these earphones offer. You get excellent bass and sound quality (better than other brands in my experience in this price range), volume control buttons (which I didn't expect at this price :)), play-pause-call button, a clip to ease the hands-free experience, durable and thicker wires, and sturdy earphone casing. This seems to be specially designed to withstand wear and tear during regular usage. The buds also have small and comfortable hook shaped grips that firmly keep the buds in place when you are running. It also comes with a small pouch to help you carry them easily. So much at this price, it's really an excellent product at this price that offers good perks along with a great sound quality."
"Good earphones and worth purchasing a second one. The earphone wire quality is also fine and there is no problem, of any sort since beginning.Noise cancellation is also satisfactory however,  in this time of lockdown since unable to move out in open so cannot test it on moving ground. But when there is lots of noise of other equipment at home then these  headphones cancel noise satisfactorily."
Liked -Hold on ears..doesn't fall even while jogging or running.Good sound and mic quality. Never received complaints from recipient of an audio call or virtual meet parties about clarity of my voice.Good for music and any audio content.Overall Value for money.Disliked - wires tangle when keep in pockets but not too much like old earphones.Using for few weeks now. No issues so far 🤞🤞👍👍
I have another two Bluetooth headphone and using since last two years. But after using so many headphone I realized that Wired headphone is best headphone even now also.Pros1. No need to charge it2. Sound quality is good3. Can adjust volume from dedicated button4. Mute and call receive/end can be done through dedicated button5. Wired quality is good.Cons1. Always there are some wired hanging on you.2. Some times its giving pain to ear.
"Used for few days now it comes with a pouch ,1 yr warranty card,ear buds extra with the headset and a menu card of boat products.Bass is nice,so far good sound quality,flexible wires too,comfortable on ears as there's support.I took lime green colour.You can take any colour.Longetivity of speakers can be only told after some months of use.so far nt bad.Wire is long if straight look its like from head to below waist the length is gud."
Sound quality and bass was ok (below average) but it was working for 2 months. Then one side of the ear phone stopped working and died completely today(after 75 days from purchase). Shouldn't have gone for this cheap one. Recommendation - DON'T BUY
"अगर आप उस तरह का इयरफोन लेने की इच्छुक हैं जिसकी क्वालिटी बहुत ही ज़ियादा अच्छी हो, जिसमें एक-एक म्यूजिक इंस्ट्रूमेंट सुनाई दे तो ये वो वाला इयरफोन कतई नहीं है। बोट हालांकि औरों से बेहतर तो होता ही है इसमें कोई दो राय नहीं पर जिस के लिए आप 500 रुपये खर्च करें वो बात नहीं है इसमें। इस से बेहतर कोई 350 तक वाला इयरफोन ख़रीद लें।~ आवाज़ अन्य के अपेक्षा में बेहतर है।~ बास बहुत बेहतर नहीं, 3/5~ इयरफोन का जैक और वायर का कनेक्शन एकदम सीधा है। तार मुड़ने के बहुत अधिक चांस हैं।मैंने 400 सौ रुपये का लिया था इसलिए मुझे पैसे के हिसाब से ठीक ही लगा।"
"I have bought this earphone 5 times and all of them gave me one common problem after 5-6 month of usage, any one side would stop working. Turns out it has been made to look strong from outside but has poor wiring at 3.5mm jack internally and the plastic used for ear bud is of very poor quality as it breaks easily."
"I ordered these earphones after using boAt bassheads 225 and have been using these earphones since two months and i thought i should write a reviewFirst time when i ordered (2 pairs, one for me and the other for my brother) , BOTH WERE DEFECTIVE ! Ordered again with a successful refund and using them since till datePros:--Very good sound quality-Very comfortable on ears and you can use them as long as you want without pain in the ears-Extreme bass , bass lovers like me would love this-Very good noise cancellationCons:--These earphones get tangled very easily and the anti-tangle claim is false-It is very likely that you would get a defective product so check for it . My one of the earphones had no sound on the left earplug and the second earphones had inverted right and left. Check for all these defects as soon as you get these earphones-the pin is straight unlike the 225 so the wire gets turned at a 90 degree angle which can result in breakning of the wire in the long runConclusion- Sound quality is really great and these earphones are really comfortable , you might get defective piece so check for that. Its a great deal although there's just a feeling i get that these earphones are not good for the longer run. Would update ya'll if they stop working."
"Its audio quality is highly addictive  especially when i listen Skechers . Just go for it . If you are having a confusion of ear hooks ,then it might can trouble you for 1 day only after that you will use to it . I don't know why Realme buds 2 have hype so much , even it doesn't have such sound quality it is broken under 1 tear and company refuse to replace it ."
Read before you buy.....This earphone is really awesomeGot it on lighting deal I have used both boat bassheads 200 and boat bassheads 242 comparnid both earphones in my personal view I personally like the bassheads 242  It's worth every pennyCause  The bass in comparison is better in242  If you are not a bass lover don't go for  thiss earphones  The hook is really usefull while moving  causee it doesn't fall off from your ears  But the hooks may caue slight discomfortPros:-  Light weight  Doesn't easily fall off from your ears  Bass quality is really good  The mids and highs are optimised  Braided cable is really usefull  Tangle free cablesCons:-  Ear hooks may cause slight discomfort  in some peoples  Heavy bass may cause ear pain(  hey  then why do you call it bass heads)Truly Value for money
"Not worth, sound quality. its cheap Chinese quality sound. Its make crackling sound some because its Chinese quality. For bass use inbuilt or extra equilizer.who has a 10 t0 15 years continuous headset listening experience definitely don't like its sound quality. Just pay for design. Also seller not sent with good packaging. Going to return."
"Theres a constant hissing/static sound while listening anything, pretty unusable at this point since I like clarity in my audio without static noises. Vexes me a great deal, should have gone for a better alternative."
I like the earphone. Sound quality is good . Bass is ok. Wire quality is average.But listening song on higher volume really hurts the ear so i will recommend not to use it on higher volume. Other than this it's worth buying.I am using from last 12 days so cant tell you the about the durability. lets see how long (days/month) it works.Review after 1 month-I am a music lover and i love high bass music but while using this earphone It casing ear discharge for me which is a serious problem and now i am avoiding using this earphone.Ps- it may be suitable for you but it's not for me so buy as per your need
Received within 24 hours. Had a great experience from the product. Very good product within the price range. The audio was excellent. Recommend to buy 😎. I got the product in offer for 399 . Original price was 1490/- almost 70 percent off 😁😁😁😁😁. Thank you Amazon for the great product with good offer.
Really loved the product right from out of the delivery cover😅 packing of boat was always unique and stylish when got into it it was really surprising as i was just expecting earphones with spare of earbuds but this company really is a standout from all of the brands it even gave a small pouch for earphones and a branding sticker. Which kept more than satisfied for the price range of 449. When all of other brands are concentrating on just package this stoodout by thinking from customer point of view what exactly will be useful.After plugging the jack my 1st expression was 😳😲😯 wooow just woow nothing else. 😄😄
"I decided to go for this product based on the good reviews i saw.But to say the truth i am disappointed by this purchase.During first time usage of the product ,it impressed me a lot but as i started to use it for calls i saw its real color.It had a buzzing sound in the background while attending calls.This buzzing sound increased as days past.I have returned this product.Moral-Dont go blind over the good reviews"
"I found the sound and especially the bass to be great. Lived upto its claim of a ""bassHead"". Sound 5. What I found bad, is the earhook gives a stinging pain in the outer ear and its really annoying. Its not something I could bear, that annoying. With that said, maybe I got used to it a bit (considering I was using over-the-ear headphones for a long while and rarely used in-ear ) and I also switched the small ear-tip to the fat-tip that they provide, and I can almost give it a 4 star review. really if sound is all you care about, get the basshead 220 or something. But the product looks good, sounds great, even for gaming I cant complain, and is uncomfortable if you are not suited to in-ear styled earphones. Feels sturdy too, hopefully lasts a good while. overall a 4 star, not bad."
"First of all I am true fan of boAt. This product was my 3rd purchase. Coming precisely to the point. The sound i experienced in this earphone was not natural as i expected, when i firstly heard audio from it, the word that came in my mind was ""Electronic, it sounds like metal instrument being played in my ears"", meaning that there was no naturality. Too much bass making mids awkward, treble was high. After all i retuned immediately and purchased boAt bassheads 100 which sounds much better. I am using 100 from 2 years and i am satisfied with that.Dissappointed with boAt bassheads 242."
Good but feels kind of cheap since my previous earphones were the Sennheiser cx275s. It's been 2 weeks and I  was cleaning the mesh in the earphones and it just got pushed in . I didn't even put  pressure on it . Small things like this really ruin the experience. I found the ear tips provided in the box to be of a cheaper quality and I found that changing them with the silicone ear tips of the Sennheiser cx275s helped make my experience better .
"All pros..The only earphones that actually remained in my ear..Good bass.Volume is so ooud, I had to reduce my phone volume to half, whereas previous ones, even Mi had to be put at full volume.I bought it after reading the great reviews.Really worth the money, they also give ear plugs of different sizes"
"Very good product. Been using it since 6-7 months continuously. Very rough usage (while traveling in Mumbai local). Still its very durable, sound quality is not compromised at all. In 80% volume you won't feel any sound from outside. The rubber whites might be irritating to some but its easily detachable. Very good product in this price range."
"It is a fine product, serviceable sound with above average build quality. The cable is a bit fragile, had to get the first one replaced.The wing tips are not comfortable and are not able to stay is place. Prime example of form over function. Also the images in the product discription show the colors to be way brighter than the actual product.Well despite my critisism I have been using them for the past 6 months and they have worked well. Basically you are getting what you paid for.Unfortunately, the moc has stopped working recently. Not sure how the warrenty claim would go. Might change the rating based on the experience."
"Boat's ear cord is always been trademark among other earphones. There is no issue in the sound quality, bass quality but little expensive to this price. If we juxtapose this one with other, definitely, we can get that, this earphone much better experience than others.Dont be late, go ahead and keep this beautiful earphone in your pocket.Thank you."
"Though the sound quality is good, the product is delicate and not built to last.The ear plugs are very soft at the base where it attaches to the earphones and easily comes off by itself if you pull it out of the pocket or a bag.There is no support to the wire where it attaches to the 3.5mm jack. After just one month of use the wire broke from the jack.Over all rating is 1 star as it is useless just after 1 month.My suggestion: Buy one with 'L' shaped jack, they last a lot longer."
"Earphones sound good with some emphasis on bass but it's not overpowering. They're lightweight and cable quality is nice.If you crank up your Equalizer and boost the bass, the earphones literally start vibrating on high volumes. The best part is there's no distortion whatsoever, good earphones by boat 👌. They sound much better than my previous mi basic.Only con is on using the earphones for 2+ hours, ears start hurting a bit.It also comes with a clip so that you can wear these to your workouts.Offers a lot for ~500₹ range, can't go wrong with this purchase.Pros-LightweightCan handle strong bassSort of braided cableWing tipsGood sound qualityValue for money ✔️Cons-Maybe cut down on the packaging, lot of paper and plastic wasted"
My Review about this earphone :1. Build Quality : 4/5 for its material and snug fitting in the ears and also for the anti tangled wire2. Sound Quality :  Base : 4/5  Voice calling : 3/5  Volume : 3/5 it can make u deaf easily on high volume ( recommend not more than 70% for music)  Noice Cancellation : 5/5 ( suppress external sound upto 90%)  For Gaming(especially BGMI) : 1/5 (not recommended for Gaming. As u can hear nearby sound so hard that you're unable to hear footsteps properly from a certain distance.3. Value for Money : 3/5  For Music : Hell Yeah  For Gaming : Not recommended.
"Best sound qualityExcellent looksEasy 2 useNever sweats while using for long timeBest in priceBeautiful pack from boat company that includes one clip, ear buds and small pouch to carry anywhere.Also recommend to have dime earbuds from 💀 skullcandy.Enjoy it."
"I've been using branded Earphones since year 2000.I used many brands , Sony , Nokia , SoundCore , Samsung , Jabra and many others.I'm not comparing it with premium brands.But according to price , here is what I think.Let's talk about sound quality.Sounds aren't soft i feel this earphones will give you headache if you listen to it for 30 minutes.Instruments sounds aren't clear , and I'm not able to hear many instruments in this earphone.Over-all Sounds feels like very flat , and sounds of this earphones irritates me.Bass is fine fine ( acceptable at this price)But except bass other sounds are very flat.If you need one year warranty and need good call quality then you can go for this one.But if you're looking for better sound quality then this earphone isn't for you.I have tried BoAt products , and i feel BoAt is all about advertisements and show off, actual products are cheap and not worth the amount they're taking.This earphones sounds same as cheap earphones you can buy from local market under 200rs.I don't feel anything special about BoAt ,And this is last product i purchased from BoAt , in future, i won't even think that this brand even Exists.I'm not a hater , but I'm not satisfied as a consumer.And it's my right to give review or feedback to help others.It was my honest review.Thanks"
"In my opinion, I don't find these earphones that good. For beginners, they can go for it but users like me who use to spend plenty of time listening to music, communicating on discord and gaming. It is not suitable.  After some point, they feel like they stucked in your ear, pain in earlobes and high pitch sound hits like an arrow.Mic input is ok, you get clear sound in quite environment but if you are in noisy environment, they capture all those noise."
"Basshead 100 earphone much better than it. Basa quality not good at all. In my view it is a cheating item. I also use basshead100 which is more comfortable than it. I fall in impress by seeing site review, but now feel that only 5/8 preplanned reviews among more than lakhs not saying truth. Hope Amazon take care of it.L"
"Guys the microphone absolutely sucks! You cannot talk on a call properly with this one because the call receiver cannot hear you at all!The sound quality is good, but a earphone is not only for that right? Its all a hands-free product for your calls! Bad experience for me"
"Basshead 242 I love this product, also I love to use boAt's products & I used 7or8 product. cause all those good products which I am use really nice & great. And boAt give their all customers the best quality in minimum price range.In this earphone the sound quality is pretty good.Bass is perfect for my opinion, volume up and down bottom & call receiving button is perfectly handy, 3.5 mm jack is not gold-plated but also the Jack is working very nicely.♥️"
"Amazing product. Value for money.Good built quality and fits properly into the ear.Go for it if you are a bass lover as it has more base and clarity is slighlty in the lower side but did pretty decent job comparing those with prices ranging from ₹1000 to ₹2000.I am really happy with this product, all I can say is that if you are going to buy an earphone under 1500 this is the best you get. Just under 500 and you can never wish an earphone under this price better than this.Update after 6months,mic got complaint and I registered complaint in Boat website, they have given me a replacement directly from the brand itself."
"I received the package today. Tried it right away. Here are the things I noticed:-1. Sound quality- bang for the buck2. Bass quality- I'm not much of a basshead but I can say it's really nice.3. Build quality- honestly the last boat earphones I had felt much more of higher build quality,but still they ended up dead in one side after few months of usage. This one is glossy and not much to my liking but does not feel that much cheap too. Cables are braided, the right nd left cable feels braided but is not.4. In the box- I got a pouch, extra tips, a clip to attach the cords.5. Overall experience- good. I'm happy for now. Sound is nice and clear just how I like it. Still I have not tested it with all kinds of music but it gets the job done pretty nicely. Looks are really nice. Best part is the fitting in ear. I had never seen an earphone fit in my ear so nicely without falling out.Will update more after using it for a while."
"Bought these earphones after reading all these positive reviews here.  So here's my review:Box contains the earphones, two extra rubber buds, a pouch to carry the earphones, a warranty card, a pamplet showing other boat products and a boat sticker.Coming to earphones itself, the build seems good enough, nothing extra ordinary. The wire from the separtor till the earpieces seems a bit thin. The wires are covered in a nylon outer which gives it a cheap look if I'm being honest.The earphones fit firmly but one might find some discomfort at first because of that rubber horn for sports activities. Wearing and removing the earphones with them is difficult as well. Though it is removable but the earphones look bad without them.Coming to the sound quality, this is where I got a little disappointed. Maybe I was expecting too much but I didn't like the sound output much. The bass is too much boosted that it just kills the other aspects of the song. The treble sounds below average because of the overpowered bass. If you want a overall balanced sound experience then please go with some other earphones. I was using JBL C150si before this and those JBLs are way superior in terms of sound experience."
So I'll be sharing my views about this earphone with you guys. So I'll be summing up my review in total of 3 points i.e. experience ‚ comparison and why you should buy it1) Experience : If I talk about my experience then I'll say that I have been using these boat earphones for 4 months and I haven't faced any issue yet ☺️ .  As the name itself suggests BASSheads they truly offers a very good bass . The mids and lows are also good. They are truly value for money.2) Comparison : As it's price is around 550 I don't think any other big brand provides any earphones in this price segment but if your budget is around 700 then definitely go for the jbl ones3)Why should you buy it : According to me around at a price of 550 they are definitely one of the finest earphones . But one of the major reason why I brought these earphones is because of boAt not just because its a big brand but also of its warranty i.e. boAt provides doorstep return pickup of your earphones in ODISHA I don't know about any other state  So I would say if warranty matters to you a lot then these boAt earphones are definitely for you .Pros1) Braided cable you don't have to worry about your cable anymore like I do 😅2) boAt offers wings which will never let the earphones come out if your ears 😋.3)Stylish and premium looking 😎.4) ipx4 water resistant 😃.5)You can use these earphones while lying on your bed or lounge these won't hurt 😉.Cons1) The earbuds are not metal but plastic 😔Hope my review will help you choose your earphones :-)EDIT after 10 months of usage *slight issues in the left earbuds* will try to claim its warranty lets see
Amazing product. Using it for almost 8 months but still no compromise in sound quality and also bass is superb.But at full volume the sound becomes crispy.but yaa you can use it at 80% volume for good bass and vocals .And also good for gaming.i played pubg .you can hear footsteps easily.Go for it if you are a gamer and good bass lover
"I'm torn between 3 or 4 stars. I'm giving it 4 because it's the best in its range i'd say.But there are downsides, the treble is very weak and the bass is overshadowing everything else. It doesn't produce the clearest of sounds because of this. The ear hooks are very uncomfortable after an hour of use.Buy this if you're on a tight budget, I'd suggest spending 200-300 more and get Sony MDR or Sennheiser CX 180.I wished boat balanced out everything for a better experience rather than going all out on bass. Not the best for pure listening experience because of weak trebles etc."

" Bought this in April 2021 to try new product which has a good bass. Initially it was working good. But after 4 months which the products is not used much, on the right side volume of the headphone volume is very less. Tried to claim the warranty but the service centre is 2 hour away from my place. Would recommend to go for other brand or Philips is the one I am using it works for 2 years easily. Earlier I had bought boat earphones after one year onside of the earphone stopped working which I had used a lot in mumbai local. In short I feel it's not a good product don't waste your money."
"This Earphones is only good for EDM, DUBSTEP and Beat lovers.. very less Clarity, Extra Bass Which makes the voicing muffled. I'd recommend you all to use the equaliser to balance the bass.  Look wise is good. Not for rock, metal music lover . . And Most importantly You can't use it for long use.. ears starts hurting after 15-20 mins of use.. I Guess it's because of That extra bass..After a week of use you ears will start hurting a lil bit..Over all OKAY experience..Sound - 3Clarity - 2Look-  4Noise Cancellation - 4Quality - 3.5"
"1. In first look and hands on, sound quality of it is good and clear(writing this after listening variety of songs in about 2 hours.2. I would say noise cancellation is pretty good in this price segment.3. This boat 242 wired earphone is far more better than my previous 2 boat earphones I. E. Boat 225  and Boat 180 in every aspect.4. Bass quality is superb, I can say this surely because already listen some dj songs, rap songs and normal songs with it and obviously when u watch movies (either it is in ott platform or in ur laptop or desktop) it's crystal clear sound in it.5. I love the most important feature of this earphone is that it has volume rocker switch, so that if anytime in playing games or watching movies or listening to songs or in calling time, u can up or down the volumes.6 Most important - Due to it's clear sound and bass quality u won't need to level up the volumes to 90% when playing games like pubg, codm etc which depends on sounds in all the time. So don't worry game lovers, u can level up the volume just by 60% to 65% ,  in sometime 70%max.  , u can easily hear in game things out clearly.7. The ear hook is good, it won't feel hard when you are using it in long time like 3 hours continuously  or 5 hours. Thumbs up for this #boat .8. Nylon qouting on all the wires is makes this earphone more durable and tangle free.9. Got this in 499RS. , so pretty much it is budget earphone in day to day use.10. I also have 4 more earphones alongside with it like - skullcandy, 2 boat earphones, 1 xiaomi basic earphone(399 RS.) , but from all of it I can surely say that this boat 242 earphone is very good in compare to others that I mentioned."
Pros : Build Quality [not braided but has a protective layer on wires].  Aesthetically Nice.  Quite a good fitting. Fits really well. Do not tend to fall off.  Has a clip to hold the wires together.Cons : Bass on a lower side (may not be good for bass lovers) yet decent.
"Ok it's descent product. Build quality is good.Sound quality is good for bass lovers. But bass reduces the other small sound effects, but it's ok for regular use. If you are a pro music listener who need every small detail of instruments played then go for some other costly products."
Ordered after reading that wires are strong. They are neither braided as shown in picture  or pull resistant as claimed. And I don’t have an option to return! This is clear cheating both from Boat and Amazon
Boat never disappointed me till now. This is my 3rd purchase. Sound quality is great in this price range. But wired is really thin bt easily last 2-3 years without any trouble. Also this is not tangle free cable.
If I watch a YouTube or any video video in my phone and call my friend.. my friend can hear the YouTube audio from my phone.. mic getting phone system audio too as input.. my ear pains after having that ear holder.. I removed that.. and sound is average and looks cheap.. and NO RETURN... ONLY REPLACEMENT... it sucks...
"The first preference was entirely because it is na Indian brand.It Fits perfectly, lightweight with above average sound quality. Mic does a decent job too where there is no complaints of distortion from either side.Tangled free breaded cable is a good touch to have along with the 1 year manufacturer warranty. Eartips are very soft and comforting which will ease your prolonged wearing hours.A perfect gift to gift yur loved ones👍🏻❤️"
"Best earphones for the price. Build quality is great, sound and noise cancellation is also very, very good. Bass comes out nice and crisp. Loud as well. I personally don't like loud music, I enjoy at medium volume levels so it is best for me. Also it has a quite snug fit in the ears so it won't fall off while jogging/workout sessions. Also you get a cute pouch with it. Will update on long term use later."
Do not go for TWS from Boat as they have very less durability and life time. I've bought many tws from Boat and within a year or two all are malfunctioning. Instead this wired earphone is more practical and can last upto same 2 years meanwhile offering better audio quality at a lesser price which will give you lesser depreciation after two years. Mic and audio quality is decent for a regular guy to handle calls and listen to music or stream online content. Good fit with very minimal noise cancellation(I'm ok with it).Best wired earphones in this price range.
"I have been using mi earphones from past 2 years and they are surprisingly quite durable and lasting but they didn’t sound so good. So i went for boats this time as i already have boat rockerz 400 and boat is getting more and more better in quality and sound. so its been quite a good time i have been using this and they are pretty good. This are awesome they dont fall out of your ear due to the silicon attachment with it. As it name says bass heads they are actually good with it bass. The audio is crisp and perfect, i would recommend them over bassheads 225. Overall quality is nice and perfect at this price point. If you are looking to get a good pair then give this a shot. You wont regret it"
"Pros--Good sound clarity and volume. (4/5)-Bass (3/5)Cons--Poor mic (1/5)-Cheap connector, the mic isn't detected sometimes-Useless rubber hook. Just a gimmick.-Hurts the ears.Avoid this earphone."
worst experience with the boat this time. I have already used many boat products but this time the earphones are worst of their sound as well as the microphone is even worst. First i thought that it is the network problem. After that everyone is saying same that my voice is cracking and they are hearing the voice like the robot is speaking. I also replaced the product. I thought this was the issue with this product only but the second one is also the same. I don't recommend this product of boat. Instead you can use bassheads 152 that is a good one.
PUBG go for itBest for PUBGThe footsteps are super clearAmazing qualityBest for musicLoud and clearSuper comfortableBecause of that thing above the headphones it holdsNoise cancellation amazingSound amazingMIC quality amazingJust buy
"It has been only 10 days since my purchase. It is too early to give a detailed review. Since my purchase I have used the earphone with my POCO mobile to watch videos and to listen songs. I will rate the audio quality to be GOOD among the mid range earphones. I have also used with my Dell laptop, to play strategy games like Northgard, Dota2. These games usually take 2-3 hours straight. I didn't feel anything uncomfortable during long sessions, as I have read from other reviews (may be it is just my personal feelings). But I feel that the earphone jack doesn't fit my laptop socket and so it reduces the audio quality a bit."
"My unit started having weird volume imbalance between earpieces within 3 months, and the call button isn't working properly. The unit is original and I've raised a complaint ticket. I didn't expect this from a brand like BoAt, I don't find this product to be reliable.Edit - only a few months later, the replaced unit also stopped working I'm really frustrated with these earphones."
This is a repeat purchase for me. First one is still working very well even today. But this new one's sound is jittery at higher volumes. I bought multiple boAt products but this is the first one which is defective. Didn't expect from boAt. Unfortunately my return window lapsed by four days due to my travel.
"A nice product nice sound, but mine product was missing the clip and the bag have issued a return, go for it if it's available for 399, will compare with realme buds neo 2 which I got for 399 too and update the review soon"

"Value for money product.Sound quality superb at this priceNoise cancellation is pretty good tooBass quality is one of the best in this price rangeIt is very comfortable when listening music, watching movies/series and also for calling.The positioning of mic is too good,very near to mouth so no issue in mic as well.I personally used this earphones for straight 3-4 hrs without any issue..So I'll give 9.5/10..Definitely a must buy product...I'll recommend it to anyone for 500 or 550 rs... Its worth the money.Adding this part after 17 days of usage.The earphones are really superb. Bass is also awesome and treble and vocals are much better than other earphones at this price range.Only thing a lot of people are complaining about is the ear hooks that starts paining aftet sometime. Well it did happen to me but I figured out that I was putting the hook in a wrong way which was causing pain. But after I corrected the way I can wear it for hours and take calls and watch movies web series easily..And also the carry pouch that is supplied in the box is too handy to carry earphones to avoid any damage and it looks really dope as well.A must buy product if you are looking for earphone at budget of 500."
So I have been using this earphones for like 5 months now so I can say that this earphone is basic good value for money but for the ones who are primarily going to use it music have to stop even I thought this would be very nice after moving from jbl earphones which is gem for hearing music but not this one so if ur primary goal music then I'd say buy the jbl ones much better bass and very good for music and u just want for meeting and other simple works then this is ok and it doesn't last very long if ur a gamer because mine has louse contact issue in just some months this is surely bad😔
"I was about to buy some other earphones from another company that are much expensive than this, but at the last moment I got to know about this earphone, and I now I am happy that I waited 5 minutes more to order, otherwise a nice product would have missed.Sound Quality: 9/10 (depends upon individuals music and sound preference)Product Quality: 9/10 (cable and mic quality Is amazing)Fitting: 10/10(I used boat earphones earlier, this plastic support were pathetic, but in this it's amazing)Noise Cancellation: 9/10(only when something is playing, active noise cancellation is not present here)"
"Nice build quality with nest metrial and sound is is very deep bass and clear vocal i was ever used any earphone have not this type of haevy bass, this is the best for all type in music and movie i have listening"
This is the worst product ever . The sound quality is worst with high tribble and no bass . I tried it in different devices but the sound qualty is extreme poor. I returned the product and purchased a MI Rs 300 head phone which gabe me high qualty as compaired with this Rs500 one. The sound quality will make you impossible to hear in full sound .Never recommend this product to any one .You will have to visit the doctor if you use it .Worst product ever in terms of quality .Please do not buy this product .
"earphones are good but its connector (the black thing by holding whom we plug in and out the earphones from phones ) is very slippery. when your phones are plugged in and  if your hands are little oily or watery( like after eating some food or after washing hands) then its not easy to plug out the earphones. ou have to use some cloth to plug out the earphones.The connector  should not be slippery . it should be rigid to hold.Rest earphones sound is clear , base is awesome in price range."
"I've been using these earphones for 3 months now and so far there were no issues at all. They fit really well in the ears thus making it perfect for sports. The audio is very clear and the bass quality is amazing. I wouldn't say these earphones are noise cancelling but yes it does control the noise around to some extent. The mic quality is excellent. One more thing I liked about these earphones was that you get a small earphone case in the box. You also get some pictures of your favourite celebrities. Also, I was surprised to see that these budget earphones have volume control buttons! If you were to ask me I would definitely recommend this product. Amazing for the price(549/-)."
"1. Product quality- better quality2. Bass - Best bass in this price3. Noise cancellation- It has good noise  cancellation.4. Durability- It is strong, but not stronger  than customer effort.5. Sound -Comparatively sound quality is.  better for this price.Buy date- 24 oct 2019Taking picture date- 23 Jul 2020  So don't think , buy it if you have money  only of it's level ."
"Here is my experience with the eaphones1. Unboxing : Here it is a bit of cost cutting. The box is not of great quality and the your unboxing experience is not that great2. Build quality : The earphones are well built. We get the three buttons under 500. Definitely will last for 1 year + under moderate care. Wires are also of great quality although they are not braided.3. Sound quality : No compromise here. It's really great. Probably the best sounding experience under 500.4. Others : I am being very blunt. The eartips are very bad. Although they will get your job done. But compare it with the likes of mi and realme. They have way better eartips and it is something you will noticeThe earhooks seemed to me more annoying than useful. We can remove them so it's nothing to worry about.You also get a pouch. It really isn't that great. Like if they were giving they could have given a proper one where earphones could easily be placed.Overall if you could manage to get 100 more, then go for realme buds 2. I have those too and you will not regret."
"Worst product i have ever used.. Mike is not at all working properly, i always getting complaint like ur voice is not audible or fluctuating while speaking in this headset. I even replaced the product and thn tried that one also has same problem. i tired of replacing product again so threw that away. Totally waste of money, pls dont buy this"
"Need to tell about this in one line, JUST GO FOR IT.. Best headphones ever under this price segment. Quality of the headphone was good and also the sound quality too good. Bass and noise cancellation were little bit low, means out of 10 I'll give 8 for bass and noise cancellation and 9.5 out of 10 for sound quality and built quality.. And also it comes with a carrying pouch + 2 set extra ear buds both of their quality were awesome. Overall very good headphone guys.. just go for it.. highly recommended 👍👍"
"If you are buying it for listening to music and you are on a tight budget then you are good to go. But the Mic is absolutely awful. There is no concept called 'Noise Cancellation', the mic itself creates noise. But the 'Bass' is quite good. But the 3D sound effect is not good. The wire's build quality is good but the earphones seems quite cheap. Personally after using it for music and gaming, I will not recommend you to buy this for playing mobile games. But for casual purposes it's reliable."
"Very good product, I was confused between Realme buds 2 and this, I bought both of them and in some segments it surpassed the realme ones like in comfort, fit and looks it is way better than Realme....The sound quality is also very good but still Realme has it better here and in quality also it is better than boAt.Hope my review helps."
"I have using this from 2020,Sound quality bestNoise cancelation is awesomeBase quality A, in skullcandy also i didn't get this effect.Surround sound also best.Till now i have bought and recommended 10+ Peace's to my family and friends.Cost is very cheap for this quality.Highly recommended and 100 % guarantee for better sound experience."
"Sound quality is great, very clear sound you can hear small details in background.Bass is good but could have been better.Mic is the best thing in this, it can capture your voice even at the distance of two ft.Only drawback is you feel pain after couple of hours of using.Over all good product, once you put this on you won't hear any sound around you. People need to tap my shoulder to call me ;)"
"This is my second purchase for the same handsfree. first one also stopped working within the warranty period, bit as there's just one boat service centre in Ahmedabad, which happens to be so far from my home it didn't make sense to travel back and forth for a 500 rs handsfree. I decided to get another one in same model as I liked the tanglefree cord, but it was a mistake.I got the new one in September beginning and iy started having connectivity issue within a month, stopped totally by the end of oct. Boat doesn't provide pickup service, and it doesn't make sense to travel to another end of the city to get it exchanged. Boat product's quality has decreased significantly"
I have been using it now for 3 months..1.Quality- the Cable and byild is not as good as like bassheads 220 they had flat strong premium cables with metal buds housing but this one is okay too..but also very light and comfortable strong fit...you can use for long periods and the sports hooks can be helpful while gym and tunning2.sound_ quality if the sound is so crisp clear and amazing... instruments separation is awesome and vocals mids lows are amazing3. Bass- Bass in this is veey clear and high quality punchy bass but not for bassheads it have good amazing bass but not like heavy super bass of bassheads 220...u will love this bass more than others because it is very punchy hard and deep but not extra
"If had to give a review of this product in one line that would be ""pure bliss for bassheads""And if for the detailed review let's starts with the packagingIt's simple clean and clearYou'll get 2 extra pair of eartips, 1 carrying pouch, earphone and booklet and a warrenty card.Now the build qualityIn the price range of 550 rs the build quality is good, the wire is sturdy.The housing is made out of plastic though it doesn't look or feel cheap.You get 3 buttons for call and volume up down, which is really rare in this price range.Next and most important is soundIt's a really a joy to listen edms and party mixes. You get that thumping vibrating bass.Trebles I'll say goodMids are lost in effect to create the bass, youLosse the details.Vocals are clear.The earphones are loud enough to enjoy songs in 70% volume level.So to summarise I'll say if you want details clear crisp sound then you have to up your budget a little bit and go for some other brands like sony or maybe jbl.And if you need the thumping base, you need  a earphone for pubg then just close your eyes and press the buy button.For the price of 449-550 it's a steal deal."
"I'm not a gym guy, so I can't tell about its ergonomics while doing gym.I've been using this for 6 months now, even now I don't get any sound distortion. The drivers are very capable. It comes with a good amount of accessories for this price range. Sound quality is just fine! Bass is balanced (the amount of bass can be changed by most of the devices).Use it carefully and it will last for 1+ years. I can also it's better than is predecessors. Satisfactory purchase!"
"Good choice for gaming ,treble quality is awesome but for listening music it's not so great because bass quantity is not good otherwise good earphone in this price range (rs400),best for pubg gaming ,the only bad experience was with delivery agent who didn't pick up my phone to receive my product morever he blocked my call at last I have to visit to delivery office to get my product ,so much disappointed and didn't expect these things from amazon"
"Pros1. Durable2. Lightweight3. Reasonable PriceCons1. Not good for exercise, walking etc, it comes off from ear.2. It doesnt fit into your ear properly.3. Noise cancellation is poor.4. The read rubber flap attached to the earbud is a hopeless innovation and I pulled it off because it hinders the headset to fit into the ear.Purchase - boAt Bassheads 152 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic..."
Review after 8 months of use.1.Durability - good. The wires are intact and i use it in laptop as well as phone. The wires are pretty strong and lasted longer than other costly earphones.2. Sound quality- its poor in high volumes. If you use it with laptops to be on calls at work then its pretty fine. Mic also is good for these normal use. Not good for listening to music as it has lot of noise3. Wearability- Comfortable while standing. Really uncomfortable while sleeping or while scrolling phone lying on the couch.4. Conclusion- i wanted an earphone below 500 rs which will not break off durle to excessive use on laptop shaft as well as serve the purpose of attending calls. For the money offered the quality is good. If you are looking for an earphone as a music lover. This option might not serve the purpose.
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
 As you can hear the quality of song. It is perfect value for money product.Overall rating - 5 out of 5Sound quality - 4 out of 5Bass quality - 3.8 out of 5Noice cancellation - 4 out of 5- Vocals are very clear even at 50% volume.- you can buy I'm really sure you will love the sound quality.
"Nice bass frequency.all music trac audioble.3d surround affect osm.connecting wiresFlexible, no sunce of year.extra length andBuds are soft.i also buy boat rokerz blue tooth over the ear headset and this one also provide me total setisfaction.thanks boat for quality controll."
Have been using this for 2 months now. The audio is quality is good. The Ear wings are very discomforting after extended use so i have removed them completely.Two Main problem areas for me are:1: The mike has to be held very close to the mouth as the other person always complains that its not audible. ( I Don't face this issue with other wired/bluetooth headphones i have)2: The link of the earpiece head and base has become loose all of a sudden and it comes off and all the wires are exposed. Even removing the ear piece lightly after use separates the assembly.Going for a warranty claim. Will update the ratings and reviews after the warranty process.**********Update:  the earpiece loose casing caused the wires inside to break. TERRIBLE AFTER SALES SERVICE.claiming  warranty on website redirects you to their closest service centers.*****On first visit the service center was closed despite working hours.On second they said they have closed office for Boat and no longer work with boat.Called on call center and it keeps you on waiting to connect with representative but never gets connected.EXTREMELY disappointing.  I have already wasted 200rs worth of fuel to visit service center for 500rs worth of earphones. NEVER BUYING AGAIN.
its have nice sound but what I experienced in boat 225 was much better even built quality was better of boat 225 but boat 242 is more attractive and it also give nice sound .its sound loudness is muh far better then its other competitors rven I tried SoundCloud q10 and claw g11 but both sound was little low as compare to this earphone butits cons is that it have loud sound which sometimes mis with other sound and create little difficulty in identifying different sound...I am using it for pubg .....and really enjoying it
"This earphone(boat bassheads 242, black and red version) is ok for some loud music jonras like rock, etc. as the bass is overpowed. People listning to light musics will no love it. Vocals are not that good but you can't expect much in this price range. But if the wouldnt had overpowered the bass(upper bass), the sound would have been more balanced. But one thing, the cable quality is awsome. And this is the only best one in this range. If you want a balanced sound, try something from jbl.🙂"
"First of all, the product was same as shown in the pictures! (Both material wise & quality wise!)The hooks can be detach from it, so u can use it as your wish and comfortable!! Then comes to the features like sound controls ,is good! & also in quality wise too, it's  too good for both sound & bass!  In terms of rating, I will give 5 stars for both sound and bass and comes to noise cancellation, will give 4.8 bcz it is not100% but that's not at all a problm. Bcz when comes too these range headphones these percentage is good enough ! (If we want 100% percentage noise cancellation nd much more sound and bass, should go for an over ear headphone like that range!!That type also available in boAt!) The last but not the least, that's about the add on things in the package! I like the cute pouch and sticker.... Bcz I am like a person who loves these kinds of lil cute things..!!  And Ofcourse extra ear- buds nd warranty card and a brochure like one also included! Overall, this is such a beautiful one type! A beautiful In ear headphone worth the price!! I loves this, boAt! Thank you for the Amazon,for safely deliver the product in this pandemic situation too, on the right time as mentioned in the order!! Thank you!❤️"
"Review after about 3 months of usage:Since I've used both the Boat Bassheads 242 and Boat Bassheads 225 as well, the review is as a comparison between the two.Sound: Signature Boat sound. Almost same in both.Fit: 242s fit better.Design: 242s have an ear-friendly, plastic bud, 225s have large, metallic bud.Wire: 225s have tangle free wire.Jack: 225s have L-shaped jack.P.S. I felt like BRICK while writing this review. (For those who don't know, Brick is a character in a show called The Middle. That's all I can say.)Happy buying!"
"This was my 2nd purchase for this headphones. Initially I bought spirit lime color. That was worth for money. Build Quality was solid & sturdy. It lasted for more than 18 months even after rough use.2nd time I bought the same piece in Neon Green color, but wire quality was compromised. The rubber coating of the wire expanded & wire got spiraled & crumpled within 5 months of use. Also one thing I noticed that coating of wires were completely different.There might be 2 possibilities: 1. Different colored Headphones have different quality. 2. This time the product was NOT genuine as my 1st purchase was from different website."
"After uses of 2 month it's one side pair are not working. But Really nice quality earphones and bass are superb. Perfectly fit on your ear and very deep bass amazing sound you don't need up to volume 60%, I get on  ₹449, in this price segment really awesome performance but wire quality are not as to much fine, But good earphones."
"I bought this earphone after my 3yr old Sennheiser CX275s broke. Though this product is marketed as bass oriented, I found it to be neutral but somewhat lags in vocals. I need to raise the volume to the top to experience it. The old one which had a neutral sound o/p had better bass effect and overall sound clarity than this one.Yes, it is not right to compare a 1500 Rs earphone with 499 Rs one but still, I was hyped with the basshead brand name. So, It is a good earphone for the price it demands and you can go for it as it is one the best VFMs in the Market. Need to check how long it works fine without any issues."
"Using it for 8 months now. I have never expected a company like Boat and that too a relatively cheap product in their ouvre, would survive my usage for that long.Sound is really good compared to ubon or other brands in this range. Boat had a diluted JBL sound, at least that's what I inferred when I used their first product, but this headphone has a sound akin to Sony and I like it. (I personally prefer Sony, Sennheiser over JBL, for their  warmer and more fulsome sound).Also the piping they did with the wire is the icing, and I believe that single handedly stretched it's longetivity.Very happy with what I got, Boat has earned my trust truly. They improved."
"Just after one month of use, it's malfunctioning and the after sales service is pathetic they have no professional approach or responsibility towards their customers.I was told to take an appointment before coming to the service center and gave me a date 10 days later on my whatsapp number.I mean if you have rules of appointment before coming to service center it should be mentioned atleast on your website.So I did not have a good experience."
"This is my 1st Boat product. My mother uses Airdopes which has amazing sound and tonality. These headphones however come affordable with an awesome design and futuristic look with dynamic sound, bass and beats which crisp vocals..really awesome for someone who likes and enjoys Rock, Metal, Blues."
"Im giving 3 star because of the product that i received was defected after 1 month , the problem is ,one side headset is not functioned , after filing complaint with boat service center , their replaced me with a new product within 5 days , otherwise i will give 4 star to this product .."
It's been few weeks and volume buttons are acting up! Probably because of the sweat due to workout. I bought this hoping that button won't stop working by catching some sweat but it was a big let down. I have ruined many earbuds while working out and this one didn't turn out to be any different. What a disappointment. Good sound tho!!
"So, here I am reviewing boat bassheads..Pros:Good(really good, thundering bass)good sound qualitygood buildCons:Bad treble-cant hear the voice unless you lower the bassWould have preferred a braided cable and insulated cableWould have preferred a warranty card to register for the product like sony....it says u can register only when your device is broken.....I'm insecure...Apart from that, great sound, great quality(not best), all good but too much bass!"
I have purchased this item on 30oct 2021got delivered on 31 oct thanks to amazon fast dwlivery.but when i started using volume button and mic not working.when replaced item again earphones received  shows same problem.so dispointed this ws first time i purchased boat earphone was worst experience.in short dont get fool by advertisement choose wisely good other earphones.once again thanks amazon for great help during return and refund process  for this item.
"As expected from boat, the sound was pretty good, the bass and treble balance was decent and also it was pretty comfortable to wear. It's better than 225 model because they were little bit heavy. The buttons helped me a lot whenever I wanted to change songs but didn't wanted to turn on my screen in the middle of night. A 4 star from me cause, if it had braided cables or maybe flat type cables I would definitely give it a 5 stars."
Writing this review after 3+ months of usage.PROS* Good build quality* Decent noise isolation* Bass is good. Bass lovers will like this but it is a bit too much to my liking* Mic placement and clarity is greatCONS* Normal cable (not flat one as the pics suggest)* Experiencing sharp pain in the ears when using for 30+ minutes (biggest drawback)OVERALLDecent headphones but poor design which brings a lot of pain to your ears!
"It would kill your device's audio jack!Boat made this marginally longer and thicker than many other things in the market; to pretend universal.Once you managed to insert into your device you might start to hear electronic voices which is kinda creepy. If you are a guy like me - used it on a laptop, Good luck with that."
"Bought these a month and 12 days ago.. as a regular user of earphones, headphones and Bluetooth devices.  These earphones are a disappointment.  After spending money on this I can officially say worst purchase ever.- Left earphones works fine, but right won't function.- The call button automatically calls, plays music, does any random thing.-  with an amazing past experience with this company I'm 100% convinced that they need to work on quality, after sales services and replacement.- I live far from service center almost 30kms but they want me to come down there and get it checked for replacement? How is it fair and reasonable?Sounds quality in first week was so awesome it started hurting my ears. Even while ridding you can hear other vehicles at distance of 6-12ft at full volume.**Update**Now the call, volume button has stopped working permanently and it's now useless. worth buy ever."
"ProsSound quality is one of the best in the price range.The bass is not that high, so its good if you prefer vocals more.It has full 3 button control instead of the one button which makes it easier for music controlConsThe wire is WEAK. It broke in a few monthsIt has no flat  or braided cable instead a thin plastic one.( it gets tangled always)The earbuds are of bad quality. The buds hole is wider which makes sound better but the quality of the bud is not good infact its worse than any boat earphone.It doesn't have L shaped or angled jack which i don't prefer."
Earphones are great in look and feel. It takes some time to adjust so might hurt few days when using continously for long time but later it will become fine. That extra pouch along with earphones is great. All round nice product at very reasonable price only issue is wire is very thin and so need to be very careful.
"Looking Good.Grip Great.Tangle free And Flexibility is ok. (If you want go with Basshead 225)Wire Quality Great.Free Cloth Pouch in the box.Pouch is not suitable for Earphone. But you can store old-valuable coins or pendrive, card reader etc.Boat After Service Experience is Awesome.So I am happy with all boat products."
Sound quality is decent. Bass is very rich. Noise cancellation is sub-par. It comes with some extra pair of buds. Finishing is perfect and colour combination makes it even more attractive.I feel the wiring is a little fragile and might not be suitable while running or walking or some other kind of movement.
I am typing this review after 2 weeks I had used this product and my personal experience was it's not comfortable to wear after one hour. Sound quality is sharp and good but I notice it get reduce after one week of usage product packaging and build is quite attractive and its water resistant and good for daily use.Conclusion : i will say please don't go for this earphone they are good but you can get better ear phones and some point this ear phone design is annoying and it's not comfortable to wear after certain time you will get this point when you use this ear phone for after that its start irritating and itching in ears I will suggest you better go for different option 😉
I used thia product for not even a mobth. JThis product is extremely bad starting from the ear bud style. Followed by the bad 3.5mm jack. An extremely worse product and i am not sure if you can claim the warranty or any guarantee.  Total loss of money.
For the money for which we are getting this headphones it works like charm and do the basic things right. Eliminates the surround sound but it’s far away from noise cancellation feature which is technically not possible to include in the package. Fare amount of bass can be enjoyed and the quality of the sound is good.
So it leaks my media audio into the mic and i got it replaced from  far away service center and the problem is still the same my friends can hear their voice from my side and also the movie if i am watching any while they are on a call or confrence with me and this is unbearable and as the replacement has the same problem and they have far away service centers this means this is the problem with every set and i want a fine replacement probably wont get any i regret my decision and will not buy anything from boat ever again wont recommend the whole company to anyone
"Good product i use it too much, i feel much comfortable with it but amazing product at this price the weirde that ng is its wire not look much good and its volume button also not feel good.....but it's base was amazing...and i also got a sticker of boat.... finally it's look some expensive"
I bought it on republic day sale so i got it for 349rs and i would say a great product in this range of price...Bass is good ...noise cancellation is amazing... Although the wires doesn't seem to be  much capable to get along with 2 or 3 years ...but 1 year warranty so ..ya that's also a good point ..I bought lime one i would suggest to buy the black one.....Sound quality is great ✨
"Sound QualityJust one word ""amazing""The trebles are just fabulousInstrument separationd are amazingHigh lows are great.Bass it is not overpowered but it gave thumping bass.I could hear the sound only upto 65% volume, it gets too loud at 100%.Sound leakage was there only at 100%Build QualityI had the Black variant and the build was good enough for day to day use. It has a rubberized coating over the wires.ComfortIt takes 2 to 3 days to get use to with the ear hooks. And they work great it holds your ear firmly.ConclusionMust Buy earphones under Rs. 500, I got it at Rs. 399 during the sale, so always wait for the sale time. Oh and also they give you a pouch which is really handy to keep your earphones safe from physical damage. Overall a great earphones under Rs. 500"
"Superb Ear Phone from ⛵'boAt' interms of Quality of Sound, Looks & Durability... There Can't be a better Product than this... Total Value for Money...👌Super Happy Customer...😊Amazed by Same Day 'Amazon' Delivery... Long Live Amazon (a 2 z ) & Jeff Bezos...❤"
"I am writing the review after the use of almost 2 year .As I aspect sound quality is great . Full of bass and punchy sound and have great price as per the quality . Wire quality is also good dont reject it by its look , it is very durable bet for sports use but not good for calls .But after 14 month its one side earpiece stop working , its earcover comes out due to cheap quality . And the mic is not good since starting . Not audible during online classes .As per my review good to buy but last for short time and not for calls and online classes. So 4⭐⭐⭐⭐"
"It's a great product from Boat. I needed a earphone which I could use while riding & this serves the purpose very well. The ergonomic Design helps the earphone to stay in place without hurting or having stress on your ears. Additional feature of Volume control helps to reduce or increase volume without having the need to take out your phone.Sound Quality : 9/10Design : 7/10 ( 7 Because of thin wires)Cons : The only risk I identified is the thin wires. Since I'm using it during riding, I am not sure how long these thin wires will last. It would have been a perfect design if they had used the Flat wire design in this particular model.Overall a Good product with a risk of Wire getting stretched & damaged."
Best in class... I can't believe boat has made such a good sounding earphone at this price point. It in itself justifies the price..... I own a senhheiser cx 180 so I know what a premium earphone sounds like.It sounds almost like a premium earphone and the sound signature is balanced not too bassy and mids and highs were clear... Wire quality is soft to touch and feels durable but have to see how long it lasts both (externally and internally)....the connector is not L-shalped so it looks like the wire may get damaged at the joint.Also it doesn't tangle in my everyday use. Overall value for money
I have been using this to mainly play COD in mobile1.The foot steps can be heard better than players around you so it works like a charm in finding those sneaking behind you or coming towards your in close range2.You can never wear it the wrong way due the ear lobes supporter or whatever they are called.3. I have slept over it and it doesn't break unless you're sleeping on a rock by time traveling to stone age.4. Earlobes will pain if the supports are not worn in a right way5. The extra clip provided to clip on to your shirts works well helpful to keep the microphone right in its audio signal pickup range thus providing consistent audio output to listener unless you're networks isnt goodFinally for better audio output do not use the ear buds that are provided as they aren't the best so if you have a friend having spare ear buds of  Sony MDR-XB55 Extra-Bass( pro tip: Ya you can fake your friendship for a while like everyone these days untill you get those spare buds  ) these ones they sit flushly in your ears there by creating its own seal thus reducing sound entering your ear from outside and creating a sense of artificial depth and clarity which the original OEM earbuds lack as they feel flimsy
No doubt gives a perfect & above decent acoustics..!!steal deal at ₹399..Looks well made (can last long for sure)go for it..one star less:you should reduce last 2 volume points to have smoother effects for bass/treble rich songs ( voice rich songs are classy n not an issue )..
"I used this headset for about 8 months, And it broken link this without any reason.First the right side speaker stops working , then I was using this one sided hearing headset for 3 week's.Now by today that too stopped working.The only thing that is working Even now is the microphone ( I tested by doing an voice recording in phone).Its little weird for the headset to stop working and broken near this pin is awkward.I was an big fan of using the headset with moderate sound levels.So I always go with boat headset as its driver fits me perfect.But now I'm totally disappointed with this product and I suggest not to go with this product for purchase.Sorry for negative review.Peace & Thanks"
"**Writing a review after using it for 6 + months**1. Sound Quality - 3/52. Durability (daily use - left earbud stopped working after 6 - 7 months) - 2/53. Mediocre noise isolation - 2/54. Bass Quality - 3/5Overall, if you have heavy use of earphones like me, then this product in my view is not recommended"
Sound Quality- WorseI mean not good at all. sounds like 50 rupees earphone. very cheapNoise Cancellation- AvarageNoise cancellation is ok ok only not too good for this price range.Bass Quality- Too worsehonestly i purchase this product for good bass bus seriously this earphone not ment for bass lover. very BAKWAAAAS BassI think this item price should be under 150 rupees. worse product.Boat I don't hope that... really disappointed 😩But i sold this product to other person living nearby with a loss of 100 rupeesand ordered Boat 225 Megnam driver which i used earlier.😂😂
"First of all the very important point is build quality, it will not go anywhere no matter how roughly u use it.Sound quality is excellent you can't listen to it on full volume although its clear enough.Comfortable - no need to adjust again and again.Bass should be become lil better but still you can't take is as con.Pouch and extra buds are useful and awesome.Surely go for it"
"So after using for 6months my review is hereBass 8/10Sound clearity 9/10Noise cancellation 7/10Durability 9/10Build quality 9/10So for this price range, this one is better option.Dont hesitate to thumbs up if you liked the review"
"Bass quality: is a bummer, though the name of this earphone is basshead 242, i feel base to be inferior and very inadequate to my taste as well as in contrast to the treble/ highs base feels rather weak.Sound profile: Clear sound. Dynamic range is ""Fine"" .Though the lack of bass makes it feel hollow. Don't go by the reviews calling it a great bass-y earphone, it's not.Good build quality- as per first impressions. Though I'm skeptical about how long it'll last.Noice Cancellation: No active cancelling(off course) but seals pretty well in ear canal so is quite adequat for isolation in a noicy bus joirney. Earphone is pretty loud.The higher end in the sound profile is overpowered. Sharp sounds are more prominent in comparison to base/lows."
"After using it for 6 months I am given this review,. Sound quality is too good in this range of earphone, buttons works well,  after using it for six months I got little problem in earphone so I decided to claim my warranty I choose ""door to door"" warranty claim,  after registering my complaint my earphone were picked up in 2 bussiness days and now they replaced my product with new one, and it is on the way, let see how it goes.I am giving 5 star in all terms, and you can claim warranty very easily which is too good, and this one is the best option for earphones in this range.Thank you."
Writing this review afrer initial use for few hours.1. I wanted to return the product as it hurts my ears (tried all the possible adjustments but it still would hurt) but Amzon wants to replace the same product and I don't see any point in that as the design itself is a challenge (may be only for me)2. The sound quality is fine however bass is not as the company advertises. My old JBL (C110) priced at 649/- as of now vs 499/- for this product is many times better (tested at the same song at the same volume and felt the difference).
"Likes:Look is attractive, fitting to ear is good, it won't fall easily, noice cancellation is good but for that ear piece has to fit properly. Sound is good and feel the bass at top of volume. Volume control buttons and play and pause button is Handy.Dislikes:delicate product, wire quality thin and seems not durable, buttons made up of plastic, bass is good at top notch volume. At 50-60percent bass not good. Fitting to ear is good but can not put for long time. Started getting discomfort in some minutes of usage."
"Bass is good and the sound quality, pitch and noise cancellation is also good.Pros:-1) Suitable when using in workouts, and running.2) Fits in ear without slipping.3) Wire is tangle free.4) supper Affordable in this price range. under 6005) Better then ang other realme sur senheisher earphones.6) Light and sturdy7) Earphone jack is made of metalCons-:1) Ear hooks can cause irritation in ears if you wear for long time and very regularly, in my case I felt uncomfortable after 50 hours of use.(don't worry about the ear hooks , they are detachable)2) Plastic earphones, not even single part made of metal.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖*IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR PERFORMANCE OVER LOOKS GO FOR BOAT BASSHEADS. 172. BEST EARHONES I've ever used.*"
"I've got myself , a Bluetooth boat headphones which is in good shape, even after using it for more than 13 months of mixed usage. So, because of the quality of the boat headphones, i went for this wired one, which is also a good one from boat considering the pricing.I liked the bass and the earbuds fits perfectly on the ears. The mic is also decent, noise cancellation at the perfect level . Can't ask for more keeping the price in mind.Good product from boat."
"I bought this earphone for audio call, but totally disappointed with the mic picking up external noise more than my voice. Also, not a good quality product for music listening in this price range. I missed to notice this product is non-refundable but replaceable, so no way to get it returned for a refund, beware!"
"Writing this review after 8 months of hardcore usage!Audio quality is goodBass not that goodDecent sound qualityAwsm fit...but sometimes I feel pain but that's rarely like sometimes attending online classes for long durationOverall it's a good oneYou can trust blindly on boat, it was my third purchase after a boat bluetooth speaker and the boat rockerz 510 headphone which is a true beast, although causes pain in ears but the bass is awsm....moreover I have ordered another pair of earphones 'boat bassheads 225' they'll probably be delivered by tomorrow so let's see..You must go for this product...will share my experience with bassheads 225 soon so that you can compare both of them as they both lie in same price range..Cheers!🍻"
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
 This earphone is hardly 2 months old and it is not working now.After like 15 days the volume in one of the earphone stopped.Now from past two days It makes noise when it is connected with phone.The audio to the person on call is not clear.Very poor performance of this product
"The product it too good at this cost itself , there is even one year manufacturer warranty along with the it. T o be precise it a astonishing product. Moreover we don't need to buy separately the ear phone pouch to carry it , they are providing along with the earphones for free which is made of velvet cloth. I am feeling glad that my mom  gifted to me as a  diwali gift."
This is actually good. I was skeptical while buying it since it was the new Boat in ear model. But they didn't disappoint. It's actually good and even durable. I love it so much. However the extra ear pads might hurt your ears if worn too long but they are detachable. The sound quality is actually great too. I wanted something lowkey for video editing and gaming. This works perfect.
"The product meets basic standard for the price, build quality isn't great, lost audio on one side after 3 months, pleasantly the replacement processing was simple and fast, I got a new one in a weeks time. The second one worked for next 7 months and one head opened up with loose soldering. So in effect including one replacement lasted for a year, sound quality was fairly consistent until the last month of failure.For the price and for general rough usage  it's decent enough."
"Another class product from BoAt.Hey Boatheads looking for bass, sweatproof Budget Headphones, well this is your answer to all your requirments.Bass 5/5Fit (In Ear) 5/5Sweatproof 5/5Tangled (Rarely and easily undoable)Use it perfect music app and Equalizer, you won't be disappointed."
"You will get ear pain for the continuous use of 10 to 15 minutes.Initially I tried the basic version of boat ear phone and started getting ear pain, I thought it might be one of the defect piece, therefore I tried the advanced version next time and experiencing the same ear pain. Not recommended for long time use."
"wire quality is excellent, mic is good, having pouch to carry earphones is best... But not that good in terms of fit not that good and one more thing.. We buy earphones to feel music, sound quality, clarity is average.. Words are not clear. If u r a true music lover than go for JBL C-100❤️ best earphone under 1k, no match of that earphone in terms of sound quality.. Even I brought that JBL C-100 three times, thebedt earphone.. This Boat is also not bad but jbl is 🧡"
"Though this is made in China but the brains are from India. A decent and good enough for the ears this headphones is. Good bass as mentioned, i use them for my PlayStation controller while gaming. A pouch too has been given to keep it safe after use. Good product for a good price."
Initially I gave 4 stars for this product. Now I came here voluntarily to give five stars. I bought a new earphones on June 2021 and it was not working properly after 6 months. So I claimed for warranty...submitted my details...Boat didn't even ask a question they sent me a new earphones. Thanks Boat You've got a lifetime customer:)
I bought it just 1 month ago and it has deteriorated like i was playing game and the sound from left side was coming from the right side of headphones and and same with the other side so basically they switched their side automatically and i am having problem in playing games so please replace with another pair of headphones for me
"Best piece of earphones I have ever bought period. And boy, have a bought a ton of expensive ones through these years. I only base this off the awesome sound quality. It's ethereal, highs, lows, bass you name it. I had skullcandys and bose ones thinking honking bass is the real thing, but these ones make me realise how wrong I was. Great overall sound quality, the melody comes just perfect through the bass which is not underwhelming by any stretch of the imagination. I bought it for 800 rupees, if you get it for less than 2k, it's a steal. (Slight exaggeration)The build is awesome too, the wire looks cool, durable and won't wind up making your life difficult. I hope this lasts as this is my second day of listening to it.10/10"
"1no. Product hai Bhai believe me 500rs me full maza.. Fiting 1no. Comfortable bhi hai and light weight bhi, Mai telecalling karta hun to almost 8 hours minimum daily continuesly use karta hun no issues found..aur bat Kare sound quality ki to mane boult ke x1 and loop dono use kiye hain dono se Bhut hi achhi sound quality hai Bass bhi Bhut achha hai and tribble bhi Bhut achhe hai..sirf ek cheez missing hai, L shaped headphone Jack...nothing else.."
"BoAt is a good brand for bass I used this earphones before not now ( because I lost them somewhere) while I'm using them I feel grate but only thing disappointing is that ear hook Because of that my ears getting pain after 30min of use so I removed them problem solved I feel gud when I used these BoAt earphones later I tried the ""infinity"" brand zip 20 earphones after losing boAt just tried new but belive me my mind changed on BoAt after listening to infinity I mean infinity is better than BoAt because I observed the vocals, Tribble, noise cancelation, deep bass for rich quality just wow to infinity zip 20 it is better to choose infinity if u are looking for a decent and Cristal clear sound with deep bass .. if u want heavy bass go for BoAt my infinity earphones also lost one week back while trip so I ordered infinity zip20 again 💗Note : for better experience I'm using bass booster app"
"12 days after buying this.Pros-1.Sound profile of this earphone is good.Bass,Sound,treble everything is well balanced.2.Build quality is superb too, even tho it's entirely made out plastic.Cons-1.Even after nearly wearing this for close to couple of weeks,I don't like the fit of this earphone, they should excellent but they just don't fit me. If you want a better fit go with the ""realme buds 2"".2. These looks cheap as hell.Cons-"
"This is my second purchase. Good earphone. Bass is pretty good. Clear sound. Good outside noise cancelation. Light on ear and doesn't hurt.Only cons in this purchase, Boat has removed the outer  protective conduit from the wire which was earlier there in my first purchase.I don't whether it is duplicate or Boat has changed the design."
"Literally the best earphones in the price range. The 10mm drivers thump a good bass, but not the best. Very comfortable and stays in ears with the hooks on. Better than the boAt bassheads 225 of the same price range. The boAt bassheads 225 are very bad for using while sleeping. But these are better compared to those and these also have in-line volume controls and are absent in the bassheads 225. I highly recommend these instead of boAt bassheads 225."
"The boat company is in impression that human ears should adjust to boat products. Although this product is nice and gives very good result and high definition output, ear pain due to buds not being soft. I have 4 different boat headphones and boat has never rectified yet. Perhaps it's a void that other companies will fill."
So I bought this product and it was working fine. But after just 1 week it started having problems. Whenever I plug in my headphones it would have that zzzzzzzz sound we all get from televisions. And then I would have to remove it and plug it in again in a different position to get it working properly.The reason I still rated this 3 stars is because WHEN it is working it is awesome. The sound quality is amazing and the bass is also top class.And if any of you are wondering why I didnt replace a defective product is because I noticed the problem after the replacement time period had expired. So couldn't do anything.
"After using for 2 months the best I can say is it's worth of money but not for base lovers, if you prefer Indian brand it's good for you, you even get warranty period which is useful (not really lol), a pouch and yes some ear buds which were missing from my box , and that Sucks the most .🥲"
Earphones are of the cheapest quality I have ever seen. Its not even worth Rs 50/-Waste of money. I bought it for in-the-ear support. But the quality of the ear support is made of very delicate silicone and not even comfortable to fit in the ears. Also the whole ear phones quality is also worst. Even the Road side earphones would look more durable than this.
"This is the best wired earphone at this price. Just can't find any cons. Braided wire, carry pouch, cable manager, extra eartips, ear hooks.You get everything inside the package.Coming to audio quality. It's amazing and the passive noise cancellation works great because of amazing in ear fit and has great bass.Also it comes with 1 year warranty. You just can't ask any more at this price..Far better than realmebuds2 overall. Realmebuds2 only looks better than this and has magnet which is missing here. But tbh cable clip manager which comes with boat is more useful than the useless magnet in realmebuds2 because magnet has no practical use in wired earphoneFinal verdict: It's the best. Just go for it."
"Go for Real me buds 2 if you like chan chan sounds with bassOr, boat bassheads 242 if you like room speaker setup like bassNone of them has wide sound stage meaning music plays close to air with out wide strereo.... To get awesome sound quality go for Philips pro 6305k"
Not compatible with my LG G6 mobile. I have to rotate its jack little to see where it will play. Wire quality is good and it will work for long time. Sound quality is also good. Should have madr universal compatible device. My previous eaephone was of boult loop wired earphone. It was good in sound and was compatible but its wire was not as good as this.
"I went out for walking for 2 days with these earphones on, the 3rd day the right ear phone started making static noises due to the light sweat entering the microphone.The microphone stopped working just after 2days and the right earphone STOPPED after 5days.Complete earphone stopped working in 8days, Now i can't even return the order...lol.These earphones are TRASH.DONOT BUY THESE EAR PHONES.It feels like i've been scamed.Go for JBL or RealMe ear phones instead."
"Just fell for the reviews, it's total crap. There is no high low mid bass and nothing it's just flat and sound like 50rs roadside earphones. Realme is 100times better than this, better avoid if you buy you will regret, since there is no return!!!"
I have been Fan of this company (boAt). Nice build quality. Unlike previous headphones (not boAt headphones) you can use boAt headphones roughly (keeping in your pockets or pull the (not too hard) mistakely). It will sustain and can work atleast 7 to 8 months. Good life shelf. The price was bit more i felt.The sound is way better than any other headphones (at this price)
Trust me this earphone is far much better than my 2000 Rs one plus bullet Z bass edition earphone. Sound quality is good. Bass is quiet low. But you can adjust with the quality for this price.Overall for people who are looking good budget friendly wired earphone please trust me and buy this.
I can't stop myself from writing this review after I used this India product for 1 hours. Its really a great product for this price. Sound quality is too good. I strongly recommend this to any one who are looking for earphones from Indian Manufacturer.
The cost is a way higher in comparison to the product and sound quality. The sound quality is not that great. It has weak bass quality as well. More of all the design is the worst problem with it. It starts hurting your ears in very short interval of time. The sharp edges in the design keep poking your ears badly. Not recommended at all.
"Sound quality is really superb, No issues with sound quality output. Only thing I'm not satisfied is build quality., Could have been better. Wire is too thin and plastic quality is not good, could have been better. I hope they improve it. Other than worth the money."
"I don't recommend this product. I trusted the brand name and thought it will last longer. But seems like, there is no difference between a 100rs earphone and this one. Didn't even last 2 months. Extremely disappointed"
One of the finest i have used ..its has an amazing sound quality ..they fit so well blocking almost 90% of outside noise . You can hear even the smallest beat playing in the background with perfect amount of bass.Water and swear resistance with good quality sound ..makes it 10 out of 10.
"The earplug got removed on 8th day of Delivery. Hence return window closed. Amazon says ""7 days over, so u r ur Own.. we don't care, it's ur funeral now"". Amazon doesn't have correct customer care number details of BoAt. Lodged a complaint on BoAt website and message assured response in 2 days.. No response so far..Even the customer care number given on their website itself not exist. I lost my money and confidence in Amazon platform."
"Boat 103 is far better than this, at a cheaper price with magnetic earbuds.. never waste your money on this product.Cons  - sound quality is poor especially at higher volumes  - poor bass performance  - No magnetic earbuds  - Jack is not good. It's not even an angled jack.  - Rubber tips/buds for this product sucks.. its bad.Pros  - It has a braided anti stretch cable.  - Nice ergonomics and looks good (depends on  perspective) & lot of colour choices.  - Its splash & sweat resistant.****** They say its IPX4, i haven't used it in such conditions to check this out"
"I purchased this headphone because of WFH and have following review:Pros: Good quality build ,sound is great, light weight, good material is used, delivered on time,packging was good, fit in ear perfectly.Cons: It has button for stop/play, volume up and down and surprised that it didn't work. During my zoom/google call through laptop I tried this buttons and none of them was working. Although i rely heavily on mouse and control volume/stop/play with mouse so not a big issue for me but it should work as it is provided and for that we have charged. So i have given 3 stars otherwise it deserve 4.5."
"I've been using Boat for atleast half a decade and it's been pretty well. I've bought a ton of Boat products. But this time Boat Bassheads 242 is a big disappointment. It stopped working in a month and they repaired it (not replaced) then again it stopped working in 3 months, again they repaired it (not replaced). And again in the fifth month it has stopped working. TBH I am not even gonna get it replaced because Im fed up of the services. Boat just lost a customer.P.S. - I keep my earphones/headphones really nicely and I used this product even less."
"Quality of materials and sound are not good,It feels like cheaper 100 rs product....!It's quality doesn't match with even It's cheaper siblings....!Don't buy....!And now amazon doesn't refund your money for electronic products.There are only replacement available..!"
"Don't expect much from these, good for regular use, ppl who spend 200-300 ₹ to buy earphone from road side PlZ got for this this will give u good sound in low budget, don't think it's very delicate material, I thought so but till now I've been using it roughly, not a single sign of damage #not a paid review FYI😂"

 Best budget earphone with good sound quality and great design .such beautiful products don't think to much just go for it simple amaze ..bass quality was low but overall nice product
I bought my headphone and I am not using my remote much but after a week just on 6 September night I soon realized that the remote had a fault in it and oops I ran out of my return date a day before if you really want my suggestion then take boat 225 or 252 somewhat like that because I have used both and yes that is better than this productWorst product.........!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!..........
"Got it during Amazon great festivalUsing since 2 weeks.. sound quality, noise cancellation and bass quality is good for music hearing and YouTube videos so far. Working good and fitting ears without paining, so far. Recommend"
"This is for sound lovers not for base lover because the sound output of this device is great and built quality is normal not too good not too bad, Noise cancelling is good not adequate like jbl.I rated this product on behalf of every terms :--1) In terms of sound quality - 8.5/102) In terms of Noise canceling - 7.5/103) In terms of Bass quality - 7.5/104) In terms of built quality - 8/105) In terms of Tribble - 8.5/10I overall rated this product 8/10.Conclusion - This is a good product under 500.Plus point 👉 the accessories with it is very sweet and good also."
"They are really perfect if you are looking for wired earphones under 500Box contains-->Earphone(of course)PouchExtra buds(2 attached +2 pair extra)A boat stickerWarranty cardAnd Invoice--Very clear audio and great bass--Mic is also decent-- Wire is thin but strong::--Only noise cancellation is not upto markSurely it's worth buying and I am using boat accessories from 9 years (6 earphones 2 head phone and a Bluetooth speaker) all in great working conditions , So boat never disappointed me till nowYou can go for this 👍👍"
"I have been using it for a couple of months. The covers put on the housing part might not fit every individual. The covers on the sound filter tip are becoming loose after using it for a month or so, also the spare covers that came along, have different sizes so they won't fit if you miss your one of the cover. This is not good for running because the filter mesh will become dirtier quickly and you can't clean it. You might feel like throwing it away after you spoil the filter mesh and you won't feel like wearing it at all after that.Overall you will hate using this product after a month or two. The sound quality is good but the user experience is bad."
5 star ratings is not for product. But it came lucky for me. Coz I had an Online interview with this new ear phones and got hired for the best job. Earlier I had attended many interviews with my old one but wasn't lucky enough. Surprisingly I had interviewed 4th one with this ear phone and have cleared all four.
I am writing this review post using this extensively for calls during work from home for 5 months - it fits well in ears and you hear good sound  both music and callsDidn't felt any issue for long usageI again bought this for my wife and she is using it - though now every one uses ear pods and blue tooth headset I feel comfortable using this for laptop callsOnly con the earbuds though they provided few extra however at times this gets detached from the headset and if you don't have a spare available you won't be able to use
"Nice product,worth for money..I have used one week as of now working good...will c how long it work..package is really good,on time delivery,headset quality good..will post one more review few months later..worth product..value for money..go for it"
"Very nice and attractive looking earphone. Carry pouch is useful. Pricewise, sound quality is satisfactory. Bass is ok. Noise cancellation is really good. Fit is nice. Overall performance is really satisfactory, keeping the price in mind. Highly recommended."
"One of the best earphone that can buy under 500 rupees. The sound quality is so great and the noise cancellation is so perfect. The design of this earphone makes it it perfectly fit in ears. This earphone will be a perfect competition for JBL. I have used earphones of different brands like JBL, syska, Ptron, Boat. But this one is something else I like this sound bus and also design very match. If it comes under 500 just go for it.Sound Quality: 4.5/5Noise Cancellation: 4/5Bass Quality: 4/5"
"Build quality and package is good. Nice earclips (but may hurts if wear for a long time), Extra earbuds, Holder clip and a nice pouch also included. Bass is quite good, over sound is Ok. Its a budget headset, so can't expect much more. But, for daily use, it will satisfy use. I have purchased the Blue one, which is quite impressive look and sturdy. Let's see its durability."
Sound Quality is not that great Sound is pretty flat / bass is totally 0.Build quality of the wires is good but the ear piece part is made up of cheap plastic and too light.I also have Boat Airdopes 381 which has 7mm drivers their sound quality is much better than this wired earphone. This time boat let me down.
Sound quality sturdiness all good i just gave 4 stars because some improvements are needed like the fitting of sleeves becomes inconvenient after a use of 2-3 months as in my case they fall off while removing the earbuds or gets stuck in the ears. It becomes irritating if it happens frequently.Rest good🎉🎊🎉
"First of i just love the design nd fit finish, then talking about it's feel in ears is good, tips are soft enought nd due to earhooks this don't fall of like boat 240 in earphones, first thig you will notice when you pulg those in your ears is is half of the outside noize is reduced nd the sound you hear is crisp nd clear with a good bass with it's 19mm drivers. Mic on this is something differnt, you'll feel like this has a active noice cancellation on, Cabel use on this earphones is also of good quality. What else you want from a 500rs earphone. Nd you can use it for gaming it goes well with it to. 🙂"
No matter what kind of earphone you are buying from boat it will always have only one issue 'bass'.Though I have to change my earphone twice because it's Jack wasn't working. It's warranty period wasn't over so it's normal for me to get a new one.Though they always delay the process of customer service and change.But soon it's going to 1 year since I have brought it so it's worth my money.Cheap wired earphones even won't last for a month. But I used it to1 year so it's okay
"They said it had a active noise cancellationBut after i bought them i knew they're actually having a passive noise cancellation system, well that disappointed me a bitBut the sound quality and build quality are awesome they can easily be durable for a whole year or more. #valueformoney"
"I got the pair in blue color for 499/- and for the price, the earphones are good. The Mic is well placed so the audio quality to the other person is great and the buttons are tactile and easy to operate. The soft velvet pouch that comes with it is good too.The only con would be the 2 thin wires from the connector to the earbuds, so it needs delicate usage."
"Writing the review after 2months of use.. noise cancelation is good but not better.  Bass quality is very good.. but it can be used for max 1 and a half hour not more than that.. we'll get earache.. if you are using this for less than 1 hour continously,  then its good👍"
Wastage of money. One side speakers not work proparly &warranty issue
"I have used worse earphones that cost more than this, this is pretty good at this price , that being said if only boAt is seeing this review I want you to listen to me. The ear phones are pretty comfortable regardless it being 10mm driver it fits little too well that it doesn't completely seal my ears even after using the largest silicon tip , I want boAt to introduce new product as such but with a bigger driver make 12.5 or even 15mm."
"Pros-Excellent sound quality even at volume 2.Earphone Pouch.Length cable.Fast delivery in one day with no delivery charge.Volume and pause play button.Cons-No heavy bass (not for bass lavers).Very Thin cable ( I dono how many days it will come, but good thing is it comes with 3layer fibber let's hope best).No L shaped 3.5mm jack.No gold plated 3.5mm jack.The design is made of plastic no metal, it looks cheap.Ear hook hurts but u can removeMy final verdict is if u r melody lover don't waste even a sec just but it ,if you r a bass lover go for some other products."
"As compared to Boult audio bass heads x1 , these earphones are very similar and the price of these headphones is higher due to these earphones has volume rockers and boult does not have.Other than that you would find everything same with higher price of ₹200.Also if you use them or put for 1 hour or more straight these earphones will hurt your ears. My ears started paining.Although these headphones are also good."
I bought the earphones 5may received on 6th and the quality of sound is average but the style and looks are awesome. After 15 days the earloops in earphone  that make it cool starts to loosen up and now a days comes right off the earphones which is irritating now after 2 months these earphones have given up and no sounds coming out of them put them up for warranty now let's see how that pans out.
I use it as a daily  gameCons: After using it for 60-70 minutes you will feel slight discomfort due to the ear wing and also you feel discomfort whiling using it in while on a pillow in bed.( the ear hooks are detachable) it gives more comfort.but it is the best wired headset in the range and it is better than their own 225 headphones...i highly recommend it for people who need A good bass headphones
I am impressed by the durability and quality of the headphones. The wires are especially nice and do not tangle easily. I was also looking for ear phones that I could wear during workout and resistant to sweat and moisture. These fit the bill nicely.
"पैकेट में बिल भेज दिया, सामान गायब था। शिकायत करने के बाद भी अमेज़न अपने चोर कर्मचारियों का बचाव करता है। मै दावे के साथ कहता हूं कि लखनऊ अमेज़न  स्टोर में चोर कर्मचारी हैं जो सामान पैकेट में नहीं रखते हैं, मात्र बिल भेज दे रहे है।"
"When I was received this product, one eartip was missing. But I have another pair of eartips(not in the box included I used) I have to my broken earphones That I used it to this earphones.Now it is fine and usable. It's not that much problem to worry about it. But audio quality was extraordinary. Bass and audio is louder than I expected. I will recommend it if anybody asked me which headset i would buy. It is value for money earphones."
"It's a really good one wired earphone.The sound quality is pretty good. I usually listen music with 70-80% volume. In good quality audio file or gaming side it's enough.Don't try to go for full volume as bass is not that high, it's unbearable on ears.Quality is good. You will also get different size of buds which suits your ear."
"These headphones are epic the sound quality is best ever. The noise cancellation also cancels a lot of noise but not too much, u can still hear whats happening in the background a little bit. They aare very comfortable there is just one problem that after wearing them for 2 Or 3 hrs ur ear starts itching. But over all it is good. If u want them for gaming I would not reccomend these as u can get better over ear headphones specifically for gaming."
The bass is quit good but when the it comes to the sharp sounds it distort them and gives a fuzzy noise in the background. The build quality looks quite cheap for the brand and as I have used many products from the house of BOAT.
"I have used it for several months, still it has super sound quality without any noises.It is well fit in our. So you can use it when you are jogging or running.Additional advantage for it is having volume control buttons.One thing you need to consider, you cannot feel pure bass in this price segment. If you want pure bass, you should go for higher price. Because it is having high sound not high bass. Bass lovers should go for over the ear headphones with high prices."
"1= Sound Quality is best in this Headphone, But some time bass was starting struggle, But if your phone have a Equaliser then adjust the bass in Your Style.2= The Built quality,  Built quality was really superb i mean in the case of built quality, This is a killer headphone.3= A wire quality was also superb, Dobble couted Wire with rubber protection.4= i am test this headphone in rain its really work good in rain."
"If you are buying this product for music,it's good within this price range ...go for it...But if your buying this product for battleground games then this earphone is not for that..it has high bass which is definately not good for gaming and it's not comfy if u r using for 2 3 hours straight....Except this gaming part everything's fine.....noise cancellation is good,bass is good,you may face a littlebit of dissatisfy in term of sound...as the bass is too high the sound is a bit low...but u will not notice it...overall it's good...if u r a music lover nd only buying it for music,u should definately try this."
"Mic quality is very good better than Boat 100 series ( I bought 182 before this and it's mic was very poor so I returned it)Wire quality is good even though it looks fragile in images.Sound is better than 182 and  it's well balanced.You'll also get a good quality carry pouch along with extra eartips.I have very good experience with boat in past in terms of warranty, they provide door step replacement without any charges.You can consider this if it's available around 450-499/-₹ {Flipkart charges for delivery while Amazon didn't charge me anything even though it was priced at 499/-₹}"
Sound quality and earphone stability while working out is amazing!! Bass is strong! Music is loud! However after just 1 year one side has stopped working. Ive used it quite roughly. Ordering another pair today! :)
"Hello everyone,I have received this headphone today 16/10/2021. I had placed on order based on the best rating reviews of customers and this experience is been worst I can say it so disappointing me that the headphone sound quality is so poor there is no bass it is just a flat normal sound with some weird hit tap tap on left headphone also the volume (-) button isn't working. The response of volume & pause button isnt quick. I would request the dealer to replace this item with a new piece.Thanks,"
"This earphone is very decent overall. Sound quality, comfortability wise, this product is value for money.The only thing which itches is its build quality. Not very durable (the wire is not flat shaped or tangle free). Wire coating is very ordinary. And the worst of all, the shape of pin. Never go for straight pin. It is a nightmare. Taking it out from the jack is basically a invitation for rapid wear and tear. And it's not super convenient either. I wonder why Boat decide to ditch the L-shaped pin for this model."
"Although my family uses boat brand earphones, but this time the product turned out to be faulty. There comes a constant disturbing sound during phone calls just like an old fan blade moving. The product was used much later as we never thought there could be any fault in boat brand but we were wrong. Should have tested when received. Time period to return the same had lapsed too."
"I'm not a hardcore fan of specs on headsets. However I see only build quality and durability. I have put it in my jeans , pulled it out ,. Nothing happened. It's built sturdy. For sound quality, I'm not the right person. The thing I liked is they provided with different size ear piece silicone to fit."
"I used these for about a year, sound quality was great for the price, but it went bad just shy of the one year mark. They were my primary sports earphones, but it seems they can't handle a lot of sweat. Overall positive experience..."
Nice product in this price rangePros:-1:-noise cancellation is good2:-sound above average quality3:-very good product for playing pubg you can easily hear enemy footsteps4:-bass Is awesome5:-i think button is the best part of this product a good quality and quick responseCons:-1:-wire quality is above average you can try to buy green or black colour they have bradid cables2:-after using 2 or 4 hour some pain in ears3:-boat should give l shap condeter4:- boat should give a better build quality productOverall a nice product in this price range of you buy this product you can not sadSorry my English is weak 😁😁😁

"With in short time period headphone is stop it's functioning. Actually left side of headphone  is not working now. My headphone is in warranty period, So I request you, please with new headphone. Really I am not happy with received product."

"Good earphones if you want heavy bass. The mic is excellent and the fins don't hurt your ears as I thought they would. They also have a 1 year warranty so that's nice.BUT: As is with a lot of boAt products, they have durability issues. The thin wire on the earbuds is easy to wear out and within 6 months of usage I have managed to screw up the right earbud. I use them a bit roughly like anyone using them for casual listening and various locations would."
Decent headphones but doesn't have excellent bass output. I found Boult bass buds X2 better in bass performance in similar price range.The flexible ear clips attach to the ear nicely and doesn't slip off like other earphones. Good design.
"I liked the earphones however I can feel the audio to be more left sided than balanced. I tried this on various devices and the effect had been the same. Also, the mic quality is not up to the mark. I am a singer and I sing using the mic to record songs, the output is, nope.Otherwise, if you just want to listen to the audio, go for it."
"Sound quality: Bass is balance little extra, feel good thumping effectTreble is balanced also and cleared with Crispi clear sound,All small instrument sound details can identify it is goodEnough loud sound at 100% volumeFitting in ear is very good and 80%noise cancellationsWire is very good quality, looks durable with extra coated ...Overall worth to music lovers as well caller ...Fitting excellent not fall down on bike also."
"If you are looking for just loud bass this might be perfect, but if you want a clear quality bass this might not be a good one. The sound is loud and sometimes sharp which might make it difficult to listen to it for a long time. Also the shape and extra rubber support gives a bit of pain after long usage.For 500 bucks this is a good earphone."
"I bought this for the second time because the first 1 is amazing! I've been using mine for almost a year and it is absolutely amazing till date. So, I decided to buy another one, this time for my sister. The product arrived within a day but the performance was so terrible I think it was fake. The bass was bad and the audio wasn't centered. It felt as if the sound was coming from the left side no matter what I was listening to. Disappointed. Service was amazing tho. They picked up the return within a day of requesting for a refund."
"hats off to Amazon for the delivery, I literally received the earphones in less than 18-19 hours. Product is marvellous in sound quality, bass quality is good tho. The reason i gave 4 stars is because of the pain which causes to my ears when am using it for a long time. Overall it’s a must buy earphones."
Was good for 1 weekAfter a week some loose connection problems in the jackReturned the product but not refunded stillDaily we are calling to boatThey're telling we will send u new product within a weekBut it's about 1 month after returning the productWorst
Sound quality is very good I have to check multiple Hollywood movies Bollywood movies event remix and much more..Kannoj cancellation is very much ethical.. if you are inside the train or at house you will get scold by your parents by not answering their calls.. it's that much cool.With this headphone you can listen Badshah songs with their original bass.. same goes for David Guetta music videos..I personally love this headphone and I purchased three others for my sisters and brother.
"This is one of the best earphone purchases made by me. It has an amazing sound and bass quality, fits well into my ear and has good noise cancellation. I always find trouble finding good earphones because most of them do not fit into my ear and falls off. This one has a good design and fits well into the ear, the build quality is very good. The mic works very well too. My voice was heard clearly on the other side during calls. It works well on both mobile and laptop. The price is also extremely reasonable for this quality. I would 100% recommend to buy this headset."
I bought this recently for daily use and mainly for long calls during WFH.Sound quality is great and suitable for both music as well as calls. The noise cancelation is also fine . Good quality at a economical price.
Saw a review on youtube that said the audio was very clear. It wasnt. Audio is heavily bass boosted for no reason which is alright for some music but makes every other video i watch sound very muffled. On top the volume is amplified very heavily to the point where the minimum sound setting is still 3x as loud as other earphones can go. So couldnt use the earphones to listen to songs as i slept because the volume was too loud. Finally earphones statted producing loud static white noise making them unusable after 1 week. Horrible product all around. Just buy jbl or samsung for budget brand.
"I'm writing this review after 6 months of usage.Initially I was ok but slowly i started facing problems.1) The wire entangles a lot. Since the wire is not slippery material it becomes difficult to straighten it up.2) The silicon holders come out easily. but its somehow locked in the earpiece so it wont fall off and lost so its a smaller problem3) The silicone caps come out easily. I lot it couple of times, luckily find it out and now being extra careful. Few times it was left in my ear itself. Funny.4) the buttons on the mouth piece are pretty hard and clunky.Although its not all hopeless stuffSound quality is satisfactory, Bass is good"
"The cable for this product comes with a rubber kinda laminated upon, it feels durable for a long time, it survived hitting a ceiling fan accidentally. But the problem comes with the earpiece, you'll find a net protecting the speaker which comes loose and can get damaged, it happened with me, would be better if it is built with plastic. Sound quality is amazing , noise cancellation done well, bass quality is fair for what Boat takes, i am also using JBL 650btnc, a premium headphone priced 10k. For my regular use, Boat gets on me more than JBL."
"Good earphone quality for this price , i also like boat brand because service is best , if your earphone not working on warranty period ,you don't want to go service center , Company send person to your address , pick item and within 12 days your new item receive at your home . this service not give all brand ,that's why i like this brand."
"hello everyone, if you are going to buy this earphone, i would suggest you to not buy this because of its built quality. Instead of this earphone you can buy same company product like boat 220/225 earphone because it comes with flat wire ( tangle free) and has a awesome built quality and i have been using this boat 220/225 earphone since March,2020. Its far better than this boat 242 earphone."
"Just got it. Listened some old Kishore Kumar songs. Not impressed. Probably the right thing what ₹399 can get. MRP is ₹1,490 which is surely a marketing tact. Comes with a pair of extra buds and a carrying pouch and a clip. It's too early to comment on it's IPX4 water resistance. For sub ₹500 it's okay.1st edit: it tangles."
If your a music fanatic like me and are looking for a budget earphones with good bass then this ones totally worth it. Under 500/- I don't think you'll be disappointed. To be honest this is the second time I have ordered it. It's really sturdy and ofcourse due to carelessness it got stuck between my bike handle and the wire snapped (this was not the first time) but it always continued to supply powerful bass.. Go For It!! 😎✌️🎧
These earphones are really worth it for the price of 449. The ear hooks are just like a fashion or for just good appearance the ear hooks dont just fit comfortably in the ears other the earphones are simply great. The bass is just really good 10 mm dynamic drivers. The earphones cable quality is also good. Overall it is a value for money product. Do give it a try.
"I like everything about this but the only one and the worst problem is that while talking on the call, I received my voice back and can’t hear talk at all. While watching any movie the voice is very less.Only good to listen songs thats all.I want to return it but the return option has been closed on 19th by Amazon.Please help and suggest how to return?My contact information:-Mob - 8003722817Mail- djvickron11@gmail.com"
"Thanks for giving me a worthless product.After a week, since u brought the product, the left side of the headphone was sounding less than the right side, gradually it got worse, now it's on the way of destroying my mobile. My mobile is getting hang because of this headphone. Thanks for giving me a defective product. Now I nit only wasted 500 rs, but also stuck with it, because there's no more return policy."
Don't buy this product. Believe me its not working after 1month. Usually iam boat product fan. I bought this for the first time after my previous boat headphone becomes old. After 1 month mike not working at all. It automatically changes volume. Over all its a mess. Other end person cannot hear me at all. Don't buy this u will regret. Go for nor boat earphone(399 rs ) one . Or some other product.
I am giving this product 3 star. This product quality is very good I can say the best earphone I have seen bust the problem with this is that this product cannot be use for longer time. My ear starts paining very badly so I have to return this product. Not for longer use.
"This earphone is worst one i had ever used.It does things automatically like mute calls,start speaker, cut phone calls and many more things which is just ridiculous. Such colours are just for attraction otherwise it is 3rd class. I think 100 rs earphone are much better than this one."
"When I attach this earphones sometimes it's not show in icon bar, and when I play game Like Call of duty mobile, from this earphone beep sound continuously comes my friend get irritated with this, I have test this earphone in various phone same issue detected, now I can not replace earphone,But listening music good watching videos good but  when I play games and try to chat with friends this issue comes Permanently, when I use different earphone every thing is ok I think it's cause of defective mike inside earphone."
"Sound quality is very good, but its shape hurts. After 1/2 an hour may ear starts paining. Only negative I found its almost 45 degree anguler shape. I am using boat rockers 255 pro, and its shape is good for me, do not hurt."
"Good Bass quality  , clear sound , no hollowness , crisp voice , only 1 con is output keeps on decreasing as time passes byI have used Mi earphones , Realme buds2 , Mivi foam on comparing I can clearly say that Boat 242 are best because they provide 1 year warranty and that too in door service , Realme buds 2Bass -5/5Design-5/5Warranty 3/5Sound-4/5Boat 242Bass-5/5Design and comfort-4.5/5Warranty -5/5Sound -4/5Mi basic dual driverBass-3/5Sound-3/5Warranty 2/5 they are just pathetic"
The boat bass head earphone is just awesome one that I have used till.The ergonomic design just made to get awful feel to the user.The quality of wire is outstanding than the other branded ones which is on same price slot.It also provided two extra buds to fit those who needs it.They have got covered the wire with a rubber kinda material..for avoiding it from cracking.Overall the earphone nailed it in the 549 rps style.
"I was a boat fan untill this purchase .you should be lucky to enjoy this ""quality product"" .I was not lucky enough bcoz my product stopped work within two Weeks. mailing them again and again ,they respond once and said their courier partner rejected .Now I'm listening music directly from my phone speaker while I'm typing this and looking at that new box ( couldn't even get the taste 😐)"
It is really amazing and I was so happy with these after looking for decent ear-plugs for months..... You should definitely go for it.... They don't disappoint at all.
"First received duplicate item I think, there was no bass when hearing and heared unwanted voices . This duplicate item was as same as original.  Then ordered replacement which I received was perfect. Didn't expect this. I had missing pouch in both original and replacement order. Didn't receive it.Overall the replacement was original, quality is good and worth for money during sale."
"For the money they are well made, look attractive, good sound, I used them for next to the pool in Goa, I didn’t want to spoil my Dr Dre Headphones, in case they got wet. Recommended"
"Its a good product overall for the price point. It has regular attributes like a normal earphone. Low bass, high treble and sometimes ridiculously high volume when the volume is max. It fits perfectly in my ear and has been 3 months since I have purchased it. The earphones for me works like a backup if my air dopes or my headphones aren't working at that point of time. I have no idea of regular use though."
Sound :Best earphone....as it give a loud sound.....n the bass of the earphone is really awesome...as I was before using boat bassheads 100 earphone n after using boat  bassheads 242 I can say that it it really a better as it's sound n bass is awesome.Bulid:Quality of the earphone is also good as it has an extra coating outside.
"Firstly i got a defective product, which got promptly replaced.Sound Quality:Like the name suggestes, this is purely for baseheads, the lows over power the mids & highs. Sound stage is very narrow and lacks instrument separation. Mids-vocals and treble is recessed and lacks in detail. Even the bass is lose. Overall not a great sounding earphones unless you are a basshead and dont care for overall sound quality and u just need bass, only then u can go for this earphone."
Pros:1)Dynamic frequency response is very awesome especially in this rate 👏👏.2) If played at higher volume No Distortion at all.3) Very light (eventhough 10 mm driver)never slipped from the ear even the removal of ear wings.4) It's jack and cable Very vey durable. 👌5) Such a wonderful treble response 👏.Cons:1)The only con is missing of solid thumping bass (225 beats 242 in thumping bass).
"This maybe just a manufacturing defect but it is slightly panned to the right. Triggers someone who's really into music and sound. The so called ""Drivers"", jar when a part with good bass kicks in. These earphones are naturally too loud. I don't use more than 20% of the phone volume because of how loud it is. I am not a fan of bass-heavy earphones. I like it more balanced. But I bought these because of the fit. It stays in my ear no matter what. The buds did hurt me in the beginning but I got used to it. Didn't have the budget to buy the airpods so I got these"
when i got rhe product i was kinda happy but later i realized how cheap it is.. it literally gives me headaches the high notes are way too loud... you cant just relax putting this. Please don't keep high expectations from this product. It broke my heart. My worse decision in purchasing ever.
"Good balanced sound for daily use. Soft eartips and the included buds of different sizes are comfortable. The lime green colour is easy to recognise in a black bag, and is not gaudy or too flashy. The only slight negative is that the white eartips show even the slightest of earwax. So, you'll want to keep cleaning them."
"Awesome product..... Best earphones under this price range.....I love it.... That's the reason I ordered 1 more earphone for my friend...Superb, awesome, best, value for moneyRating: 10/10 ( in every parameters)"
"Sound quality in the left earphone detiorated after 4-5 days.Got it replaced with the same one, but again as mentioned in the title of review, got a similar one which had a faulty left ear phone..Returned it back, and bought a bluetooth earphone of a different make, ofcourse on Amazon.Amazon is trustworthy wrt delivery, return/replacement, but they can not guarantee the products they receive from the makers!"
very nyc exp with this earphones. i used nearly fa one month and i am reviewing this.  aftr contn use of abt 1hr it starts paining .  there is silica coating on this red colour. so if anybody is specific about the coating select it correctly.worth for money..  long enough wire so that u keep the mobile in pants and wires reach ears comfortably..  clips to hold on to shirts very useful..  mic at the midway of right ear wire is really useful while driving..
"There are lots of earphones available in this price range like mi dual driver and basic , realme buds 2, boat 225 and JBL Earphones but problem with them is extreme bass which lead  to distortion of audio quality in mid tones and low tones and vocals are not damn clear to listen, but this 242 have done phonomenal job to balance the sound signature and it’s the 2nd best earphones in sound signature after sannheiser 180 street 2  under 800kAnd other earphones are metallic which is heavy and may cause pain in your ear after long useBut that is not the case with this 242 and its ipx 4 rated so no issues while using outdoors in rain or mistakenly fell in water which is a life saver sometimes."
Sound is not soft. Not supporting MacBook Air properly . Unable to control volume and feel like the sound is pinching in ear. Earlier I was having boat rokerz 255 and that sound was amazing. Having that impression I bought this earphone but disappointed.
Have used the product for about 3 hours and it hurts around the ears due to hard plastic body. Bass is just at the basic level like any other headphone. Sound quality is nothing better than any other normal headphone available this is an honest review. The wire quality is awesome and looks trendy but lacks sound quality. Not really happy with the purchase.
"Guys this is a must buy item! It have a really good sound quality. Noise cancellation is also good. And the bass quality is next level. If you want to check the sound quality and bass quality of the earphone check it with bohemian rhapsody : we will rock you, because this song have many different instrument play in all high and low tune.  I'm reviewing after 2 months of use. It has a good ear grip. PACKAGE INCLUDES: 1 boat earphone, 2 pairs of ear buds, 1 velvet cover fot keeping earphone safely in backpack or pocket while travelling. It's really worth money."
I am highly disappointed this is the second ear phone post replacement i get rhe same kind of piece it doesnt fit correctly not sturdy and if it does ..u cant wear for more than a hour..the sound ìs very low even in the highest volume compartively feom othr brand and old boat earphones
The first prodyct given was too loud and the have anmoying bass like 50 rs headfones....this was replaced and these one are ok. May rate 3 for thisnproduct...good for young crowd whonlike to listn loud music....not good for peole who have heavey use for calls and meetings..
"I bought the boat ear wired last year in Oct 19th and it’s going to be an year in a month.It worked like gem for last 10 months and I am seeing this issue for last 2 weeks...But now voice is not working on left ear and only right side voice is working... normally I maintain gadgets very well. But for this one, even I maintained well, it’s broken now. I hope someone will look into this and provide an alternative option.. will wait to hear..."
"I personally use Sony XB series but, bought it for my mom who listens to Radio on her basic Nokia. Tried it on my smartphones (with PowerAmp, manual Eq). I am pretty sure Sony can't offer this performance at this price.Given the price, this is the last bargain guys.WOW! Not comparing Sony here. It was just an adjective!It didn't come no near to my Sony XB. But it's worth the money, on discount, surely"
"If you are going to purchase it, think twice before taking such step. I have been using this product since June 2021 and it started showing problems after 1 month of use, so far I have managed to go with this. But now I have frustrated with this. There is a problem in right earpiece, when ever I am talking to some person the earpiece starts producing buzz sound and sometimes there is a click click sound if you move your head even a little bit. But I stable mode it's sound quality is very good."
"Read Down ⬇️(genuine buyer original review)✔️Sound quality, Bass quality, Build quality is aursome.It fits perfectly into your ears, that enhances the sound quality.❌ ""Only one disqualifier the net inside the earphone is sensitive.If you're having dirt in your ear then it will stuck on that net and will reduce the sound quality. I have experience this problem and when I tried to clean the gum or dirt the net went out."""
"It's good! First I ordered it, recieved a defective one (not physically) the opponent who's speaking with me had a pulsating buffering tap noise! Then I requested for a replacement and got a good one! This is the first day I'm using it it's good. After 3-5 months I might give a performance review! So far good!"

 Look too goods realistic hd with bass sounds quality it's a great deal with Amazon thanks to providers making this type of quality products 💥🙌
The sound quality is not that much good As I was expected and the major concern about this headphone is it started pain on ears within just half an hour if you listen continuaslly. Not recommended at all.
Pros :• Good fit and light weight.• Satisfactory build quality.• Good Bass and sound profile.• Decent length.Cons :• In line remote's play-pause button malfunctions sometimes i.e takes too long to respond or triggers google assistant.• Vocals in music are not very clear. Don't expect exceptional sound quality.Conclusion : Buy in sales at ₹399 or less otherwise not recommended at ₹500+. Other option is Realme buds 2.
"Purchased it in feb 2020 and writing my review after 8months of usage...this is bang for what I've paid(189rs....yes 189rs only)..Bass-9/10Comfort-8/10Durability-10/10(for wire) and 7/10(for ear buds)**NOTE**:-IF YOU HAVE SENSITIVE EAR THEN REMOVE THE REMOVE THE ""SILICONE EAR HOOK""👏Go for it❤"

" Don't buy this earphone. I give 1 star becoz of quality of wire, quality of wire is ok. Sound is decent, no bass. After sometime of use one side earpiece is stop working.If you don't believe me buy it and regret it later. I am regreting to buy this product. I usually dont write a review of any product which I buy from amazon, but today I write this review for you people, becoz you don't waste you hard earn money on this product."
"Bass totally missing, what i have ordered for what does not get the same feeling as per sound quality. It is ok ok not too bad and not too good simple with not that much music quality good."
These are too good if you ask me for the price range. Didn't expect an earphone to be so good at this price range. It sits up pretty well in your ears and you wont have to keep the volume 100 at any point of time. It is so good that in indoors even 60-70% volume does it. Probably when you go out and there is a lot of noise will you have to keep the volume at 80-90%. Go for it eyes closed.
"I bought this product on April 1st and by today that is after almost 20 days the right side ear bud is starting to malfunction whenever the wire is moved. May be I have recieved the bad quality product and also it states it has 1 year warranty and i jave only used it for like 20 days almost.Apart from this sound quality is very good, bass is also very good and noise cancellation is satisfying. I would have given it a 5 star but due to the malfunction of the eaephone I can't. If you are buying this product make sure that u got a good product and not a damaged one."
"Fantastic sound quality with bass, clarity and almost perfect highs and lows. The wire, however, doesn't seem to be of that quality. The volume rockers and control button are quite small to get used to. But at Rs. 349/- I hardly have the room for complaining."
"It's very good for the rate . Easy to use  , thin . I got a spirit lime color and it's awesome , especially when I go for walk it's really nice to listen to music . The earbuds are soft and colourless . If one set was in the colour of wire it would look good dashing."
"worst design ever. Long term use gives pain in ears. The extra rubber given on top of earphone is of no use. At least they could have given magnets for both the speakers, so that the wires don't get tangled.No designing features in this earphone, Its old model only.Use it continuously for 1 hour and your ears 👂 hurt. Its one of the worst design ever.Check the lesser price earphones, they have the latest designing features."
"Good product with excellent sound quality, very good noise cancellation and nice bass quality only issue is bit highly priced. Colour and quality is exactly as shown in pictures."
3rd Class Wire Quality.Maximum Price should be Rs. 50 OnlyAndCOUNTRY OF ORIGIN - CHINATRUELY REFLECTING IN ITS QUALITY.
Please dont purchase these earphones.Issue of noice cancellation is just irritating.Need to plugin and plugout again and again cause of cheap bass qualityLot of disturbance during play ⏯️Automatic mike gets startedNeed to adjust the plugin by rotating which is ridiculous.Starting it was good but after a month its just horrible.Amazon services are good but the quality (boat) is not good. Don't waste your money on this product.
Overall product is good but the right side of the earphone is always defective (has no bass) . I would suggest to purchase boat 225 instead of boat 242. I am using boat 225 for nearly 9 months and there is no sign of wear n tear or defect. I am using boat 225 all day non-stop but also in very good condition. This boat 242 i purchased and first time came right side defective and then again after replacement also same problem arised. ....................................
"First Impression : Feels kinda premium. It feels like it could get a bit further in to the ear. Not a firm fit. The green one has much damper color, not same as in the picture. Volume is way good. Overall not bad.After 1 month : REALLY BAD MIC. Longer use is uncomfortable due to the design, if you smile or do any facial expression, it does hurt and irritate. More treble than bass. Volume buttons are very helpful.Casual music listeners, joggers...etc etc go for it.If you are going to use this for calls, don't buy this."
"Sound quality is good. But only the sound quality doesn't matter. The ear hooks got loose in just a week and it even comes out if you keep your headphones in your pocket. The clip when mounted, bends the wire. The 3.5mm plug is not L-shaped and at times its very hard to unplug it from the device as the grip is small.Sound quality is good but think about the above before you buy."
"Sound quality wouldn't disappoint you.. It's superb..The only reason I've given 4 stars instead of 5 stars is for comfort in ear.. I'm not saying that it's uncomfortable ..But it's not that comfortable too.. I can keep it in my ear for around an hour..After that it starts paining..So it's quite difficult for me to watch a full movie continuously with the earphone.. So as far as the comfort issue is concerned, I would say it's okay okay.."
"Well the built quality is okay but I do not understand why there are so many positive reviews regarding these earphones since there are many others better and cheaper than these however I was fooled by reviews otherwise I would have gone with my Mi basics that are cheaper and much superior to these in terms of sound quality, so do not buy them if you are conscious about sound quality otherwise the built quality is okay of these headphones and I would update my comment after using these for sometime on durability and all"
"overall i would give it a 4.5/5 its a great earphone under this price segment , but its very thin and feeble quality earphones like they are very thin like quality can be a little bit good , its earbud support is broken due to its thin wire , over all the voice is good , mic quality is also good , bass is excellent and noise cancellation is not that much good if compared to asus or bose earphones , but under 500 its best ,..hope this review helps you ...."
"Decent sound quality for the affordable price. This is my 3rd boat earphones and each time the earphone jack fails first than the speakers. Boat needs to seriously look into this issue. For that reason, im giving only 3 stars"
"These earphones are super cool. It has all features I want that is Volume up/down, Received and end call, mic, can change song, pause and play button. I love this earphones. I bought it for my brother too who has iphone so these earphones are fully compatible with iphone too.The green color is also very bright and funky."
"I bought Boat Bassheads 242 on July 2021. Sound was okay for me. But, the button controls (play/pause,volume increase/decrease) did not work. I asked for replacement, which was provided in 2days. The replacement also has the same issue. The 3.5mm pin was not a perfect fit for my mobile as well as laptop."
"I have ordered this as per the reviews , after receiving the product i released that i have taken wrong decision, the sound quality of this item is near to road side 90 rupees earphones , they said extra bass but there is no bass only flat sound is there , the wire quality is average, design and fitting is good"
"As I have used boat products earlier and never had any problem with quality, I opened and after testing the product once, threw away the box. That was a mistake, only after 1 day of working properly, the speaker volume became very low, even when the volume was full from my end. Through mike worked well, and other person was able to hear me, we could not carry on any conversation. As I did not keep the box, now I am stuck with this non functional product. My sincere suggestion, do not waste your time with buying this. There are several other brands that have wired headset at similar price point."
"The product looks very classy in the advertisement. But the actual prodcut is very flimsy and looks very cheap even for Rs 522/- I paid for it. The sound quality is good, bass is very pronounced, not sunding natural. Just 2 days of use. Don't know how long the wires will last as they are very flimsy.Also bought this item thinking that it is a desi product. But later realized that it is made in China, though the company may be owned and operated in India. So it is another chinese knock off in Desi name."
As per the price the earphones feel premium and are of great quality. The audio output is supreme and I love the bass of it. The noise cancellation is okay as such. They feel really sturdy and strong. The pouch given is really helpful in carrying it. We also get extra earplugs in the box which is a really nice touch. It also comes with built in mic and volume buttons which works fab. As per the price I guess it's the best in the segment. JUST GO FOR IT.

 Only one ear bud is working and another is not its 1 year warranty but not working properly.
Please don't buy this product.There is a problem in production of this earphone.In the beginning you will get a static sound from right side and within some days it will increase.Your microphone will not work properly and will get damage.And your controlling buttons will be stuck.Overall it will not be in a condition to use.And you need to replace it.Even after replacing it you will face the same problem.
"Just got the delivery. Wires are way thinner than i thought. Bass and sound are fine. I don't know if it will last long. Hope it does. Joints are also very sensitive. They claim that it's water proof but, the previous version i bought (bassheads 242), went crazy when exposed to a little sweat. So, not gonna take a leap of faith with this one. Will also advice anyone to do the same. Other than that, i am happy that an indian brand is providing such great products."
Pro:Tangle freeSound quality is goodCons:1)There is no grip provided on the jack .so Little bit hard to unplug2) for long time use little bit pain on the ears.
"I got boat earphone thinking the qaulity of these will be marginally more tusting or superior, but i have again been let down.The earphone were working perfectly for only 2-4 days after delivery- this made me think all is well. So I thew away my packaging. Rookie Mistake. DO NOT THROW THE PACKAGING.After the first 4 days the mic completely died. Making me thin something is wrong with my phone or laptop, but not the earphones(AS THEY WERE JUST 4 DAYS OLD!)Anywho now they are lying around in  the house. The only value it adds is maybe the pop of color it brings to my messy drawer in which they lie buried."
Product is not as stated in description. Disappointed. This way ears are gonn get damaged soon. I have used high volume devices but quality can be felt easily. N the worst is I cannot return this. I can only get it replaced. Plz Change this policy Amazon
"If you are a bass lover, this is not for you.Sound quality is good though, But only till 50-60% volume. Dont go beyond that, you will thank me later.I would suggest you to buy boat airdopes 241(Only for bass lovers). They are bit pricey than this one, but are worth it for that price"
"Have been using it for 1.3 years now the best earphones ever.It works the cool i am impressed ,i am a boat fan and has been using it's speakers ,earphones, headphones but this is the best it again impressed me a lot among all those"
"I tried to reach out to their customer care and it just provide message having link for their website. There is no way of registering the complaint as it just display the service centre list as per pin code. However if you will try to contact on given number either they are wrong or not reachable.I bought their products earlier for family and experience was good in terms of quality, customer service and everything but it's getting worse now."
This is my second purchase in 8 months. Fist one stopped working after 5 months and this one after 12 days when the replacement window closed. Not worth at all. Also I can go for exchange but service centre is so far that my commutation cost will more than price of product. Don't buy
"The volume is high, crisp and clear. Bass is not so high, but good at this price point. The body feels premium. Mic is adequately sensitive. At this price point the earphone is good, and highly commendable."
"The quality of the earphones is top notch for the price that you pay.  Fits nicely in my ear. Little uneasy when you wear a helmet. The wired is silicon coated which adds a nice touch and feel. Doesn't get tangled like other earphones with normal wires. The pouch that was provided is nice.Sound quality is impressiveOverall, very happy with the purchase."
"Boat's earphones are best in their range, no other brand provides such a quality. It's noise cancellation is also pretty good, bass is even good.Particularly this model of earpiece is amazing, as it's of sufficient length, has a clip, mic, and they have provided this very cute tiny Velvet pouch, it's too small of contain that lengthy earphones though.Provides 1 year warranty.So overall it's worth of it's price."
I switched from Skullcandy to boatMy first purchase from boatFully satisfied with the product qualityGood cable lengthCable is Fully hardened10mm drivers done their jobIn line mic is good and volume Rocker is very handy to control volumeComes with 2 extra pairs of buds and 1 earhooksVery light weightAfter using sometime u forget that there is something in earsThough plastic housing for drivers they are of good qualityIf u are choosing between 225 and 242 go for 242225 comes out of the box with metal buds and they are bit heavy in earsComing to sound quality 4/5 cuz previously I used SkullcandySome drops during playing lowsBass is goodWorth for money
"Excellent as expected- got them for conferencing through laptop and mobile,Not too much bass so irrational in ear is reduced considerably can be used for long time,Sturdy wires that's really good. Clip and accessories are plus point-Quality packed in the range"
The sound quality is average. Mic is great. If u are more into calls then this one is a better deal because the position of mic is very much where your mouth is not in the middle like most earphones . Its a good product in 300-400 range. Don't buy it if price is more than 400
"Its good for a regular user and worth spending.See when u will first time listen with it,u will not feel that much good about the sound quality and thats because u have already been using another headphone/earphone so your ears are used to that headphone/earphone and thats why it takes at least 6-7 days for your ears to grab a new type of vibrations.This is my honest opinion and I swear your ears will feel its real quality after a week."
Bass Is awesome Feels Like Dual Driver.Damn I can Feel My Ears vibrate. not Painful At All . listen to Songs U Like 🤣499 Puta Paisa Wasol The Case Could Have Been Better . but The Bass Is Better .Will Be Duing A Durability Test . rough Use Should Last Like 6 Months Sweet Base. i Only Listen To Trance And This Is Just Awesome Noise cancellation Is Awesomewaterproof Tested Working fine Does Not Come Of while Running And also at 130 KmPh On My Bike Its Still There . cable Is Strong Can Easy Manage To Pick Up ur Phone Without Breaking The Wire.Class Item Hai Bhai.
1)Bass is not their.2)sound quality is not good. quality of sound is cheap as cheaper earphone does3)it's not made for music lovers4)looks funky and cool but not at all comfortable5) for longer period of time if you wear it hurts (more than 30 min)6) the tilt shape near the buds hurt alot only after if you wear more then 30 min7) the louder you increase the volume it pins your ear with only trebal and vocals as like cheaper earphone does.The main thing of this it hurts if you wear more than 30min
This is my 3rd boat hands free and this is the best of them. Bass is amazing and at the same time doesn't hurt your eardrums. Noise cancelation is there and it fits very well. Additional pouch to keep your hands free dirt free is delight (could have been a little bigger though). So 4.7/5 is my experience with this.
"Quite an awsome product by boat.Boat always rocks. Its been my favorite product since last 2 years I am using my headphone and now I ordered the wired earphone.Sound quality is good, built quality is also good but the the ear fitting quality which holds the earbuds to the ear is not that up to the marks cuz it hurts after a certain period of time. The only thing which I thought need to mentioned and needed to be replaced by the boat. And on other platforms that quality, sound, bass all are up to the marks."
"The earphones are amazing. Comfortable to wear, the wire quality is good and bass effects are smooth. The ear hooks prevent the earphones from falling from the ears. Just the problem is with the treble. When you increase the volume the treble exponentially increases and it kind of ruins the experience. But overall the earphones are good and quality of sound is clear and crisp."
"I have bought these boat bassheads 242 and the sound output is awesome.I can say this since I've use JBL, Skullcandy, and others in the past.And these really match to the level of others I mentioned above.As far as look is concerned, the look very sporty and amazing.If anyone is considering a wired earphones below Rs 500 and yet expecting quality output, these are your pick for sure."
"The boat lovers might get offended but to be honest i never got a decent earphone from boat under Rs.2000.And this one is same too , the bass boost is off balance . sound is not pleasant , the earpiece is large and feels uncomfortale , so you cant wear it more than two hours . But in the price range I think it is a applicable product .But if your interested to spend a little more then I would recommend using sony earphones , it will cost to you a little bit more than the boat earphones but it is worth it ."
"I've been suffering from this earphones problem since long, then my friend suggested me this, I bought it and the experience is soo good, best thing is it's adjusted very well in the ears, and sounds are soo good, I'd recommend to listen ""Light of the seven"" in this earphones. thanks me later."
"Awesome bass. Lovely sound signature. Good noise isolation. Sweat & water resistant IPX4 rating. Trendy, sporty colours. Durable build, but everythings plastic. Packaging could be better. Nice velvety pouch."
"They're good, sound quality is clear, the base is good not like too much boosted but in the right amount. They fit in ears perfectly and don't fall off. Just the wire connecting earbuds feels thin but it's ok...Edit : after 1 year of use they are still working awesome, although some rats have chewed the wire but still they are working fine after such harsh use and being stretchedEdit 2 : the wires connecting buds are just like clay now, they get cuts out of no where, they have gotten way to soft and weak"
If you need a basic headphone then this is really great. The sound quality of Boat products have always been impressive. The mic is also good and well placed. The cord is long enough. Overall a good buy.
"Hi, I have purchased the boat earphone recently.The sound quality for this price range is good. The bass is not that much great but okay. If you are using this earphone for smartphone with equaliser, then it is working fine. It cancels the noice and it is okay. The cable quality is good.The microphone for this earphone is not good. It make a bad hissing sound in audio. If your are expecting a high quality earphone for mixing and mastering, then this product is not for you. It is also not good for meeting apps such zm, gm, jm etc etc. As per the price range, this is an okay device."
I am really impressed with sound quality and build quality. It has just arrived. I have tested it and couldn't resist from posting a review. I will wait for 3 months and post another review after regular usage.This will be my best friend during the lockdown :-)
The plastic around the earpiece hurts even on a very short use.Headphone jack broke with 2 months of use.I would suggest to go for other boat products as they are much better.This is unfortunately one of the bad ones they have
"This earphone is okay in this price range. The base quality is really good and it is very good for gym. It's water resistant too. But I feel a kind of suppression in sounds because base is very high in this earphones. The mic quality is also okay okay....not soo good. And, you can't listen music all the time because after certain time it starts paining in your ears because of it's very hard quality. And yess this is tangle free"
"Ok so this worked reallly well. The bass was good, the sound quality was good and it was attractive. I bought this on 12th September 2020 and I'm writing on 10th October 2020. It's been around a month or so BUT thereee is some kind of loose connection at the place where the two wires come from and suddenly I can only hear the sound from the left earbud unless I hold in a very specific angle which I obviously can't. Its annoying because I love listening to music and having only 1 side is just GAH. So idk if this will happen to you also but yea"
"Have replaced so many earphones now, all of them ended up getting their wires cut. This one lasted long, has a coating over the wire hence that problem of wire getting cut is gone. Have used my earphone for more than a year now. Although it is having slight issues now with voice transfer and noises when on call but i am happy with the product. It was worth the money i put into these."
the product replaced is not upto the quality as expected hence return initiated on the next day. Amazon confirmed return and refund process and informed the item will be picked up on 31st January. but till no action has been taken.  status shows that return initiated on 31st Jan and no further action taken by them. No contact number of Amazon hence unable to contact them.
This head set's colour style features are very good but the Bass quality is very very poor. I heard some rock ..dance.. song which play very clearly but the Bass comes out very low. Otherwise the headphone is good user friendly and comfortable for ears.
After two week of use my personal review is that this earphone is great for both watching movies and playing games.The noise cancellation is great and bass is awesome too but the mic records a lot of background noise otherwise the product is great.I bought it for 542 but now the price is reduced to 399. G for it now..
"Bass is very high. It doesn't sound good. BoAT should improve the bass quality.Also, wire seems less durable.However at this price no other good options are available."
After a few days of running the sweat broke it's controls. I used it on my ipod. If i plug it intto a phone now the volume or the Google assistant starts to act up. The volume goes to max or Google assistant keeps comming up. Same with Apple. It start up siri constantly and changes the volume.
"Everything is fine for me from sound quality to comfort. But I received damaged box I don't now whether it is due to packaging or seller intenstionally send this but overall the earphone are in very good condition . I had used headphone before so I found a vast sound difference but if you are like me looking for compact and easy to carry thing ,then you can go for it."
"This is my 2nd boat and I found it worst, product is worst manufacturing quality wise as well sound quality, don't buy this ,go for redmi brand ,sturdy and good sound quality in 400 ₹ only"
"What h clear punchy bass , superb sound quality , very good from any other products of jbl , realme , one plus ( I tried them also) in this range under 1000 I can also say best earphone just go for it u will never regret I am guerranted uButIt is strictly only for music lover (movie , videoe , music ) not for gamingDon't buy if u want a gaming earphone ( go for boat  baasheads182 for gaming )"
"I don't know why this only happened to me but trust me I purchased this earphone 5 times and guess what this earphone only survive for 1month, I actually keep care and keep very safe but after all stopped working after a 1month, very disappointing."
B4 buying i hav read its review n one person had wrote its sound quality is ear deafening.. it literally has..It comes with a cute pouch has extra buds.It has extra powerful voiceNyc beaded wireBeautiful lime colour..Facinating to eyesBut i don't its for heavy usage..It will surely damage ur earsI don't like to use ear phnThese are for just in case.. kind ..So they are nyc for person like me..
"Update after 4 months UseThe pin got twisted. The ear buds have got lose while there are spares but it's too soon. Noise cancellation is ineffective. Seems it's build to last 6 months only.Old review on purchaseGood product for the price. Very comfortable to wear. I had some doubts initially but got used to them pretty quickly. Only complaint is the volume button does not work effectively, it's not much a problem for me so didn't put up for replacement."
1. Sound quality below expectation2. Product material poor quality3. Non-user friendlyWire quality is not good as shown. Another most important it's not user friendly product as your ears cannot bear it for longer duration. The designer must have thought of coming up with such product to ease human experience but it lacks. Sound quality is average.
"This earphone has the worst microphone, I ever used. Trying to return it but perhaps its under replacement policy only. Looks are also cheap. They have tried well to make strong wire but it looks really bad. Although they provided a nice carry bag. The only thing i liked is the carry bag."
"Likes: It's a good value for money.  Good bass, so good for music.Dislikes: can't use for long duration, causes pain in ear due to buds.Since bass is high, hence voice quality for calls is not so good.But over all I say with this price tag it's value for money"
"I giftes this go my sister on Rakshabandhan and she was more than happy to receive it. The earphones are really good with an attractive neon green color, boat icon on both sides and comfortable to wear. Well, even the sound quality is satisfactory. I should say, the best product from such a good brand - Boat, that too in a very economical price. So, you can go for it!"
I am user of sony xb55 headphone.  So I decided to buy a under 500 Rs headphone.  After research and reading reviews I decided to buy boat 242 headphone which driver is 10 mm and sony xb is 12 mm. Surprisingly the boat have more bass than sony xb.. So you have think why buy a costly headphone. The major difference is that you can listen song uninterruptely with sony xb series but hare you couldn't. With the boat if you listen loudly then you surely irritates by an hour...you can listen low and mid rang with long time..
Product got damaged so soon.Jack is not working fine connect and disconnects continually. One side ear bud got torn from the wire. Now it's unable to use and I tried for replacement with warranty no response from the manufacturer.Product got damaged so soon and unbelievable that amazon and boat provided an worst peace of product to me.Provide me an exchange product as I have warranty for it....
I suggest you dont buy this if u r a bass and music lover...i had lot of expectation from this product but it cant even reach 30-40% of expectation...dont waste time and money here...for me boat nirvana bliss is best..go for it..
"All over sound quality like vocal, bass are awesome.Best feature is that earbuds are so fit in ear that you can use it anywhere like Gym, running,sports activity.After 5 month use I can say that it's awesome earphone in this price.Any other earphone under 1000 can't beat it,even boat basshead 330 wireless rs 1600 also can't beat it.Believe me it's awesomeI purchased it rs 500It's somehow similar OnePlus wireless earphone which price rs 1900"
"One of the best products ever introduced by boat.This review is based on 6 months use of this product.Al though it is the first time I have used this model from boat, but I have to admit that I bought it after lots of references from different sources and I wasn't disappointed.It's build quality is flawless; applaud the use of double coated wire with the braided mesh.Sound quality is the best in this price range catagory.Treble and bass is balanced, still you can hear a minor vibration at high volume but it's not that distinguished. It is the side effect of all the long hours I have put in this."
"Dont read the reviews, i dont know how, but they dont justify the product for sure, i though every boat earphones are amazing but thats not the case here fr sure. It might be possible i got a defective piece but whatever i received was horrible, the earphones were blurry and doesnt have base at all."
First of all somehow the headphone jack didn't connect properly in the jack of my phone I had to give it to my brother cuz when I tried to return the earphones they didn't let me return or replace it at that time and it's much weaker that the bassheads 225 it doesn't even have L shaped 3.5mm jack the plastic which is used in this feels cheap compared to the 225 which ironically share the same price most of the times and sometimes even lesser than this
Feels like they have used amplifier. I dare you listen to a song at full volume but at this price point the best earphones you can go for. If you have budget over ₹1.5k you should go for sennheiser with mic but for less than ₹1.5k you won't get better earphones that this. After 3 months of use still works as bought yesterday.
"Nice headset. the color of the headset is awesome. the ear griper is another advantage to hold on ear, it wont fall easily even in running. Totally decent product for this money."
"The earphones were very uncomfortable the first time I tried them on but I thought I might get used to it. Turns out comfort was not the only issue with them. I know boAt is known for it's bass but what I didn't know is that it'd be at the expense of a good overall hearing experience. The bass is so high that it actually ends up muffling the dialogues and other sounds. I can see their use in rock music but in a normal movie ? Nope, not the right choice. Also, did I mention that they are not at all comfortable even after a few days of usage ? Anyways, I am going to return them. Hope I get a refund and not a replacement.P.S. - The Samsung original earphones were the BEST."
"I am writing this review after using 3 month of this earphone.This earphone has good bass, sound, quality as well as noise cancellation is also good. You are not going to complain about these parameters after buying it.This earphone has sufficient length of wire which will make more comfortable while traveling or jogging.The earphone's earclip is soft and comfortable design in compared to other earphone.At first earclip generates little pain in ears but after using 1-2 week  I am comfortable with it.I got it in 499 rupees. The price of this earphone vary between 450 to 550 during sales.It is better against boat 225 in sound quality, bass.But in compared boat 225 it is not good plated and it not fully matleic (partially Matleic).As well as boat costumer care service is also good.Updated reviewIf the metallic part of earphone (3.5 mm pin cap & earphone joint part) got scratch the whole metallic part will loose the colour like a layer of paint (or like stiker)."
So I just received earphone two days before. I am writing this review after using it for 2 days.Sound all over great.Bass I would say not that good but its pretty nice at this price. So you can actually hear music great no problem at all. I would say the build is actually good at this price.The earphone is also good and it doesn't cause pain in ears while using. I used for continuous 3 to 4 hours no pain at all.Overall Good soundNot great but nice bass.But at this price range it is good
Good quality earphones but won't tell you to purchase this model and colour because it gets dirty very early and the Jack wire gets twisted so u can try another one
"Had bought this so that I can use it for running, stopped working in one ear right after a 30 minute run, didn't tug or pull the wire, it was the sweat!! They advertise it as sweatproof but I doubt they have even done the bare minimum. The audio quality on the other hand is trash. Try spending a little more and go for better earphones if you want to use them in the gym or while running."
"I don't know about others, but personally I didn't liked it. The sound quality is very loud and noisy, I felt irritated after using it for some time. Yes the sound is clear but it's not gentle and you don't feel comfortable while listening to music. I am planning to return it. I felt the treble to be bit more than usual which results in irritation."
"1. Bass isn't as good as the BoAt BassHeads 225, and i personally prefer the 225 sound quality better. This seems like a filtered down audio quality, like it might be very so slightly watered down, compared to the rich audio experience of the 225. The difference is minute though.2. The ear hook really makes sure the earphone doesn't slip out due to long duration of usage, is sweat-proof, and is good for a high movement workout (if you can manage the cable)3. Gets tangled pretty easily4. The ear hooks can tend to prick sometimes over long periods of wearing them"
"I would have gave this no Star at all , as campare to prise it's just not worth it. I would never recommend this to any one , please don't waste your money on this . The buit quality is not good Plus the sound is not clear .. never expected from boat .. just a small suggestion , if you to be on top don't make this kind of pathetic product at least make the built quality good ."
Sound Quality - 4.5/5Bass - 5/5Fitting - 5/5Features -5/5(Everything is top Notch above).Durability - 2/5I mean In just 6 months - One side of earphone gives low sound output and mic also doesn't work well.Earphone parts are dismantling and what more could I say... I don't think they will replace it with new one after lockdown I'll try to avail my warranty.If they replace it I'll update here.
it's paining in ears and here it is clearly mentioned that this product is no return after placing order you can only replace it.If you want earphone go to same brand product i.e. price is 349-379 product name not remember
This headphone is very loud and has a good quality sound but it's wire is so thin that it could break easily. This headphone has passive noise cancellation which kind of works in some scenarios.
"Sound quality is only good not superb, material and cable quality is awesome look also is super class.*if you are searching ""deep bass"" and much better quality then don't go with it (3star).*If you are searching for regular use and normal use like study gaming and watching movies then you can go with it (5star).*Noise cancellation is good (4 star)*Mid range good quality product.*Im simply happy and satisfied with this product (4star)."
I have purchased 3 of these recently and they are awesome. I definitely recommend it for any students or those who want a wired earphone for use with laptop as well as with your android phones.
Product delivered and I opened box plugged that headphone into phone and one side of the headphone is not working .what a worst😡 product.dont buy it by seeing offers .One of the worst service of Amazon delivery delay . Don't buy it the service is worst by Amazon
"I am using this earpiece for last 10 days and I found this one really good. Here are my observations till now. Will update you more after using for a longer period.- Sound quality is really good- Build quality is above average.- Bass is really good, didn't expected that good. Not so high not so low.- Noise cancellation works fine.- Cable length and layout is also good.- Ear clip works fine and it make this earphone sporty. Though I felt a bit pain in my ears after using it for longer period.Overall this earphone from Boat is a masterpiece in this price range in my opinion. I would definitely recommend to buy."
It is best sound quality and good in build quality... It's fit in your ear... It's good for gym..it's not easily fall down from your ear..It's bass not so goodAnd it's have no any wire cover  in neon-Green color productIf you want average bass.. SoGo for this... If you are dam fan of bass soIt is not so good for her/him..if you are dam fan of bass... You should go with jbl..Noise cancellation are also good..
"Bass is like spread across,not consistent and trebles are average,I saw all reviews and thought it's grt so ordered one,but frnds,plz buy boult loop for 350(far better) or invest little more and buy Sony c50hi or realme buds 2 and remember,the people who give 5 star to everything are not experts."
"The headphones both speakers are already malfunctioning. I bought on 1st October, there's still 1 month left. The problem began after using for 6 months. It was fine in the beginning but hardly long lasting. The service centre has no space left to take up my issue for the next 1 month as all slots booked, that is 35 slots per day. Boats quality is disastrous."
"I am using it for almost 1 month . As a honest person I will recommend you to avoid boat products , boat products are only a hype in the market .I will recommend everyone to to go for mi or realme earphones .this boat 242 earphone have very cheap build quality and are always prone to any defect. My earphone's mic is not working and even warranty services are not good."
Build Quality is average not bad but not too good it's ok ok... audio quality and bass is good but noise cancellation is poor...and it hurts when wearing for a long time(you can use it for a average of 30 mins)the ear buds are not comfortable enough but it's good enough for listening music and using it for calls for a short duration of time... overall I can rate this as 3.5 out of 5 ...in this price range boat bass head225 is the best option available from the brand which is sold for 550-599 during sales you may get it around 500...
"Earphones are good and comfortable, sound quality and mic is also good.I have used boat's other earphones but they are heavier and feel uncomfortable some times  but this one is light weight and I don't have any issue.The only thing I don't like about this product is the wire is not flat and gets tangled easily."
"Good noise cancellation, great sound quality and Bass. No complaints regarding the in line mic and controls. Snug fit.I switched from a 162 model to this, in ear support took a day or two to get used to. But, one of the best sounding earphone in this range."
Bought this for my nephew and he loved it. The noise cancellation and bass is great. Amazing headset and the jazzy color makes it even trendy. Full marks for the complete design.
"Worst product chinese.boat is just about name.Yeah it has good reviews,but its not durable.it works good for a or two months."
It has been 1 year since im using it! I am a Rough user! I accidentally washed it in Washing Machine! Damn! 🔥 No problems at all! It is still working as if it is newly bought! I have stretched the cables many times but Wow! Not a Break or Crack at all!!! Loved it as it is the Reliable earphone you will ever get at any price!❤️❤️
"i previously owned boat 252, which were amazing and lasted for 2 years with no problem. My usage is extremely less. Diff is the quality is a bit low. wires are too thin. they have sent a small bag along. If you use that bag, the wires will break sooner.2ndly, voice is good. there is treble effect that you can hear. also, the surround tone is on sonit helps with noise cancelling.3rdly, earbuds are made of bad plastic. Not so long lasting.I like it as i lost my other boat and ibwanted to try something new. But eventually, I will buy other boat soon."
"So my life was pretty dull before I bought Boat BassHeads 242. I had no girlfriend, no job, but after getting this, life turned around, instantly women started noticing me in public, and I now am dating someone for 5 months. I highly recommend this."
"It's really good for bass lovers, it is really bass boosted if you use it with a good sound equaliser i use the realme sound equaliser of the music of realme and the output comes very clear and HD. I don't recommend it for gamers you can play there is not any big problem but you have better options if you are buying for gaming only. This earphone is specially for music and bass lovers."
"I like the product initially with the sound quality and the fit but with in a year I was end up in mike issue and some trouble with the one side of speaker. I just try to claim the replacement and mailed to the boat support team. They got the damaged headset from me and they have tracking mechanisms for checking the status of the ticket, issue for their side is they won’t update the status properly to customer and due to covid situation I don’t think they have working technical support team to resolve my ticket. I am really frustrated in following up with them. It’s be more than 3 months and I haven’t got any proper updates. Not even replying via email"
Loved this earphone its bass is out standing... build quality is great...if you're getting it for 449... Grab it. It's better than boat 225 and ant w56.. good for jogging. Design is  Good build quality is great. Get black color earphones. And cherry on top is it's has volume control buttons too... nobody gives volume control buttons in this price.It's awesome earphone.
I'm still using this earphones continuously from last 5-6 months.I have to say its perfectly made finished product in this price range.Sound quality its super crystal clear sound better than its previous basshead model and also mic quality is too good.Bass is perfectly balanced you can say between medium & high level of bass just like previous model.It's build quality is amazing rough & tough.It's wires are tangle free with plastic coating so it too strong 💪.And its also water resistant that is the plus point.And at last its too stylish in look it's complete package in this price range just go for it.
First of all I like the delivery timing i ordered it on 20 April and it is delivered by 22 April.Secondly packaging was good.Now coming to product review...Product is awesome at this price range I ordered spirit lime color at Rs. 399 and at this price range I got a nice price range.Also the sound quality is good and giving immersive sound..LightweightSporty lookAlso got a pouch to carry it....
These are so so earphone.... Only thing is good that sound clarity is good..... It seems that these are Chinese earphones with boat branding.... Dont buy this product at all.
Brought this headphones in the month of June2021 and one side stopped working in the month of Oct2021… it worked hardly 6months… when tried to log a complaint in their website but was unable to … called customer care waited for 1hr (from 57 queue) at the time when I was in 3 in q they say they are busy and will give me a call.. it’s been days but no call back.Worst product and worst customer service
"The first time the delivered product had all sorts of issues with the cream being no mic. But, amazing return policy of Amazon gave me one of the finest value for money product. Believe me, this headset is fantastic. Recommended!"
Awesome for bass lovers best bass I've ever got... Fits comfortably snugs in with the flexible in ear hook. Good lengthy wire very useful for tall users...and sportsmen...Doesn't flash awkward looks simple and neat with great performance... And expected perfect mic placement...thumbs up from me....
"Awesome Headphones,I fall in love with these headphones so I bought two of these one for my brother and another for me.And fall in love with boat to for sound and everything,And their service is also good ,Last time I bought a headphone I phases some issues in that it was in warrenty after 11 month,so I went to the boat service centre I received another headphone within 15 minutes, Thanks a lot BOAT."
I loved the product in fact i ordered multiple times however every it didnt last more than two month both ordered Boat Earphone wire broke apart idk it happend to me frequently. I've no compromise with its internal quality but its wiring is disappointing 😔
"Alright, I used this product for almost a day now...To start of... I love this! 242 is amazing and truly worth it... The bass was something I would never expect for 500 and the quality makes me even more sure that this is definitely more than worth it!Pros: Quality,Bass and a few more items like the clip and the pouchCons: My right ear pains if I use it for like 3 hours or so... PS you can remove the ear hook and it should be fine and that's probably it!"
"The Earphones by boat is nice and Durable, This is my Second Earphone Same model By boat. This Earphones have Excellent Durable and Rubber Coating that Make the Earphones Durable. The Sound and bass is Also good of this Earphones. I personally Like this Earphones for his Durability and Toughness. In 500rs to 600rs This Earphones are Excellent. Thanks to Boat For Amazing Earphones. ❤️"
"Got this for 399High bass, fit to ear, good build build,Awesome sound quality.""Feels like a subwoofer inside ur head""Awesome bass effects on pubg mobile.Value for moneyJust go for it."
"Boat is make Best quality products for music Lovers. I love the boat & Amazon for Best products.  Come to the Pro's &  Con's , there is a no Con's on this Headphone. Because it's Produced Good Sound Quality that's Pretty, As along as Usable( its doesn't hurt ears), it's Durable & Taggle free. Design and Build Quality is good it looks premium on this budget. That's it guys  I hope it's helpful you, thank you 😊😊."
"I have two earphones both same model 242 one is neon and other is orange, neon have better wire quality while orange is worst eve plastic of orange earphone is bad and it got got damage from many side in 4 months while neon is still in same conditionas it was 8 months ago. Although sound is same and both are working but don't buy orange one its material is not good go for neon or black you will be fully satisfied."
I'm using boAt roackerz BT since an year and thought of buying this when I'm out of battery. But after I saw the product it completely disappointed and I didn't expect this with boAt.  It's looking like a local product and didn't feel sophisticated while using it.
"Its a very good product at this price. The voice quality and noise cancyid super. It is durable and comfy yo use. Genuine, you get the product replaced if in guarantee period."
"In this price range these earphones are simply awesome. I got boat bassheads 100, bassheads 225 and bassheads 242 and no need to mention bassheads 242 are farr better than these all with a really heavvvy bass and more balanced audio. The comfort of the earphones is incredible and you wont even feel like you  are wearing these on. Ear hooks too come handy with outdoor activities. No need to see any further reviewJUST GO FOR IT."
The sound is good if you are listening to music or video but unfortunately it's not very useful for taking calls. I received many complaints from people whom I spoke with that there is a disturbance in sound while talking.
I've been using this from last 7 months(Brought it in Feb 2021) and before completing a year one side earplug is not working ...and the sound quality is disaster ...when I plugin to my laptop it's making a noice that's so irritating that cause headache ...you can't use it for more than 2/3 hr ...I'm just fed up with this earphone ...now I can't even return or replace 😐 I would never recommend this earphone to anyone.
"Hello everyone,This is really nice Earphone in this price list with one year warranty.Nice built Quality and Design but I am Disappointed because of sound Quality  which is not good..People who are looking design and good built Quality can go for it.I am Using Mi Earphone Basic with Ultra Deep Bass & Aluminum Alloy from Last 1 year and trust me this is best earphone in sound Quality..."
This is a very good earphone in this range..bass and sound quality is so good..u can't expect more in this range..it's durability is amazing..this sky colour looks so beautiful..go for it and u will not be disappointed 🙂
"It gives excellent sound reproduction, cancelling all outside noises. But it does not fit well into the ear. It needs to hook on to the outer ear to fit well. As of now, it keeps falling out constantly. The present hook design is not good."
"As described the product dissent meet its description at all.. NIETHER THE BASS IS GOOD NOR THE CLEARITY EVEN IF U PUT FULL VOLUME IT'S DOESN'T SOUND LIKE I ARE IN FULL VOLUME.OVER ALL I FEEL CHEATED WITH DESCRIPTION,I HAD USED BOAY BASS EAR FONES EARLIER IT WAS GOOD BUT THIS IS REALLY BAD REALLY BAD."
"What I liked most was the way the ear pieces have been designed. They fit snugly and due to its unique design, it doesn't come off with every movement of the head."
It works good with my pc but not my phone. With my phone it is not pairing sometime. Voice is excellent. Happy while using in pc but not with my phone. Sometimes it works sometimes not.
"I bought this product on 4 jan 2021, and i was having problem with mic so i registered the complain on boat service on 23 may 2021. My earphone was picked 25may 2021 And guess what it's almost 6 month passed i didn't received my product back. I called customers care many times, waiting list is almost 1/2 hour everytime. And i never got the satisfactory response from them too."

 ✓Best fit to ears and it creates a vacum✓Noise cancellation is good at this price range✓Good and clear audio quality✓Nice clicky durable control buttons✓PVC durable wires are used which is good✓Mic is working perfectly✓Cannot expect more bass but it is balanced with its  crispy and clarity sound✓Just go for it it's worth every penny u invest in this  one.
"with this price tag this product is decent to use, cannot hear audio on high volume as pitch is very sharp. BASS is just ok overall decent product to buy and use."
"Product don't meet the quality of advertisement.Uncomfortable in the earProduct shouldn't be called basshead as the bass is not upto standard.Fragile plastic materialHigh frequency elements such as hihats and snares leave that agonizing shrill stinging sound.the low quality of the product has left me astonished, can't believe realme has better earphones in terms of sound quality and material than Boat."
This earphone looks quite ordinary and I also don't think it's cable is tangle free as advertised.  It stays in my ear that's plus in comparison to boat basshead 225 which I had ordered along with this earphone and sound quality is good. Ear hooks are detachable but without ear hooks the tip is uncomfortable in ear so no benefit regarding that. Overall it's okay.
The best product for this price. You may get it for around 400-500. Definitely not worth the mrp cost 1500.Very decent fit and ergonomics.It has volume rockers and play/pause buttons which works on iphone android and also on win pc.A decent sound quality for thr cost.Bass lovers would hate it.Music lovers may not be impressed.But part-time listeners and best suited for callings and meetings.
The earphones are fine as long as working. I had to replace mine after just 2 months as microphone stopped working. And when i had gone to service centre this seemed to be a common problem. Repair person didn’t even check my earphones before giving me new one. That means they are aware about the problem and issue seems to be for larger product batch. Better to avoid this brand. They have money to hire stars/cricketers for marketing but can’t maintain product quality.
"Bass is missing and it distorts at full volume of a smartphone, if it can't handle full volume means drivers are not powerful enough to deliver good sound and at low volume levels like 1 or 2 from 30 it doesn't give clear audio.Stay away from this, go for Boat 225 you cam feel the bass punch in your ears."
They are what they say - bassheads. But lacks deep bass and mids are low which somewhat loses the true good performance of this. But the clarity is more than its price point. Truly. Beginner sound enthusiasts should try these. Long use will hurt your ears(mine did).
"I wanted to purchase an earphone with a decent sound quality and I generally prefer listening to music with high trebble and base. Honestly, this is what I wanted. A perfect product to buy under this price range. In my personal opinion, just dont go for earphones worth 2k-3k, they are waste of money and I bet this earphone gives a tough competition to those expensive craps. This one is more than enough I must say."
"It's been 1 year now I am using this earphone.Sound is amazingNo deplition in bass quality or mic .Very good rubber and cable usedI have earbuds too, but I have kept this esrphone just for Calling purpose because People says my sound feels good when am talking through this one.Ty"
"Value for money - got myself 2 this time. I love the ear hooks; infact, I have been buying Boat ear phones for quite sometime now - never been disappointed. The ear hooks are a winner; you can't manage a ear phone without the hooks - they are a must to tame the ear phone."

" Sound quality - 7/10Base quality - 6/10Build quality - 6/10Over all - 6.5/10In this price>If u are searching for a wired earphoneFor active activities like jogging, running, cycling, and little bit of exercise then it is the best earphone u can go for it.>But if u want an earphone only for music like u love deep base and good sound quality and if built quality does not matters for u then there are more better option available."
"I got this on offer by 449 Rs.All I can say after 9 months of usage that this was the best product I have ever used.I never used premium quality earphones though , I always use below 1000 Rs product.... but in this price segment This was best imo.Sound quality excellent,bass excellent it just compromises little bit in case of noise cancellation but thats ok.Thank you Amazon , Thank you BOAT for the outstanding product."
"Bass - check (4outof5)Built quality - check (3outof5)1 pouch free, perfectly fitted.But...! After 1 months use its not working anymore..! That's why I hate boat..!🙂Please don't purchase it."
"Hey everyone. I got this earphones few days back and it's mic stopped working. I tried to register a complaint on Boat since this product has one year warranty but I am unable to download it's invoice. I registered my complaint on Amazon and they promised to revert in four days, it has been more than ten days now but there is no response from their side as well. I would suggest you all not to purchase this showy product. Thanks."

 Itz very comfortable to use....And it doesn't create any pain or uncomfortable...It has good bass sound system...And it is very worth for cost!It has volume buttons and hooks which makes earphones very good and awesome look..so don't miss it.... 💯%
"After seeing so many reviews, I felt it would be good.  No bass.  Poor sound quality.  Better to buy Sony or Sennheiser if you want quality , it may cost you little more."
"These are the 7th set of earphone/ headphone I have bought from BOAT and they just work flawlessly. Others are different models and they still work good but I felt like buying new ones for a change. As always, NO REGRETS!"
In first impression Sound quality and Bass were excellent at this price point (400₹) and boat had places extra buds of small large size along with medium size attached to earphones and finally a small pocket size bag to place the earphones But delivery speed was pathetic maybe indian post will deliver faster than amazon normal delivery even package handling was worst package was crushed like there is nothing in there but luckily earphones were good and they sounds exceptional
Not worth more than 200rs. Packet was damaged and opened by someone before me. Earphone had scratches as if it is refurbished and not new.Edit: REPLACEMENT UNIT WAS UPTO THE MARK. QUITE NICE BUT CERTAINLY NOT FOR MUSIC LOVERS....GOOD FOR GYM.
very bad quality....very bad...the boat earpods have problem ..i use it while walking or running ...it just changes songs as i touch or just by my movements......
"While the product is good, the earlier dispatch was incorrect and later on Amazon replaced it. The ear hook while is fibre based it’s not something which is convenient over a longer call and need to keep adjusting it. But its fixed and it doesn’t fall while on the long calls. I haven’t tried while walking or running."
Boat makes the worst wired earphones. Within 2months of purchase the mic stopped working and earlier i also used Boat baseheads 152 which stopped working from the left side within 4month of use and i was not even able to return/replace it to boat as their customer care number does'nt work.I wrote them emails but their was no reply.Boat's wired earphones are not durable even if you use it carefully..Go for skull candy or Jbl instead.
"This headphones looks are pretty good & stylish, but the sound quality is very average.No more sound effects.Just a headphone with stylish look"
"Sound quality  is not good , uncomfortable  , sound is very loud , it be uses for calling not for music,  at this price 500 we can say ok , but  I can't  reccomend  this to by who want to use for long time it can damage ear"
I ordered a boat earphone bassheads 242 red in September.....and in October it's jack not working properly music automatically change and stopped any time.....it's damage only in 1 month...the 100 rs earphone is worked fine more than it.....there is no difference between 100 rs earphone and this 500 rs earphone ..so this is the worst experience ever from boat....I willl not buy anything in future from boat...
Nice soundNice bassNice grip when wearingNoice cancellation I would say is decentIt's overall really good deal🥳And packaging was great as well product reached in good condition 👍
It fits perfectly in ear and also looks wise its good. One big problem is that the wire between the ear piece and the connector is very very thin and I am just afraid that it might break anytime so extra care is needed.They say its strong braided wire but its a play... only the wire between connector and joint is thick and strong but that part of wire generally never breaks.So its good in all aspects but the only requirement is for you to handle it with extreme care.

Phone calls and music both are well managed by headphones. Overall built quality is good. I bought Orange color .. it is somewhat yellowish... Not prefect orange...
"It was working ok when received. After 2 weeks the earphone function buttons stopped working. When connected to device, some times sound disconnected and going to device speakers.Overall quality poor in my opinion."
"At first I thought the bass was too much, but it's because u switched to a new earphone,but once I got used to it, it grew on me, firstly the bass is like the top quality, and sound quality is better than most earphones out there, noise cancellation is too good, I'd recommend this  highly to people who are looking for the best quality earphones at this price range"
Though Amazon workers' did a good job in delivery... The product made me to get disappointed as the audio quality is not good. Actually the product has been returned (because of the audio quality)  and got another one. But that new one is also not good.
"I've been majorly a fan of boat earphones. This is my second earphone (242) after boat 225. Sound quality is superior, bass quality is excellent and I like how these one come with an in ear fitting, though, for longer use I'd recommend to remove them else it might start paining your ears. Quality is fine. I'd appreciate if the mic quality improves a bit. Difficult to talk, at times. Overall 🌟🌟🌟🌟 but a year's warranty compels me to add that one missing 🌟. Thank You for amazing product!"
I loved this product. The sound quality was great I played Bgmi with this and even on half of the volume I can hear all the sounds property like enemy footsteps. The noise cancellation is awesome and heavy bass. Must buy!!!!
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
" This product is awesome 👏✊👍 sound quality and high price I'm purchased 6 month, S ago good"
"Value for money u get sooo many things shirt clip extra buds warynty card build quality is mind blowingVert very nice productU can face some issues with its weight, little bit heavy sooin starting days u will be uncomfortableLong time use ❌Perfect fittttt❤But if u have small ears it can create problems to fit😂😂"
"I had Boat 100 and 150 Earphones previously but this one hurts. They give u three size option for ear buds, removable flaps, but nothing worked. It starts hurting only after 20 minutes. Disappointed with this one. Good sound quality has no use if u can't keep it on for 20 minutes straight."
Though music clarity was good there is not enough base if u r a music lover u r searching for base please search some other this not really suit music though it is marketed as base head and it material overall good not prudent to and its very tangled while not using.
"I've been using this regularly since 10 months and I really loved it!!Sound quality and all is superb, No doubt!!The best thing is its STRONG, the wires look thin but actually they are strong!!There's a thin transparent coating over the green wire.I usually break my earphones wires...this the longest time I've been using one earphone.Functioning well!!"
Pathetic earphone stopped working in 10 days flat. No return so your money goes down the drain. Stay away boat is one of the worst
Won't try to comment as a connoiseur of sound systems..as a common person who just uses headphones my input is good price timely delivery happy with quality used now for 2 weeks. Wire quality very good does not entangle.
"Got these back in Jan, 2020 and they are working pretty fine. I listen to a lot of rock, metal and EDM tracks, sometimes at pretty loud volumes. There have been many instances when I had unintentionally pulled its wire. I have exercised, jogged and freshened up while wearing these. And still, there have been no damages whatsoever because of rough use, water splashing or loud continuous bass.Would definitely recommend to anyone in this price range."
today on 12th October I received it & from the beginning I can't here any sound in the right side of this earphone+the noice cancellation is just a joke+ bass is not working properly+ sounds are came out from the earphone after music started+voice calling sound also not good.I can't expect it from boat.just dont buy or go for it if u dont waste ur money.
"No complaints about my boat's bass heads 242 model except for its Easy Access Controls (or in-line controls) which started malfunctioning on me for whatever reasons. Neither could I regulate the volume with Easy Access Controls nor could I play/pause during media playbacks. This happens most often if not every single time. Also, another malfunction of it being, at times, device fails to recognize the earphones at the time it's plugged in. Overall, I would give it a four star out of five."
Mediocre at best. I use them only for night movie watching. This damage on one day of in 'jeans pocket' travel. The bud also fell off somewhere.Please avoid completely.
"Idk what the hell is wrong with Amazon and it's seller Appario Retail Pvt ltd, My first earphone was Realme and it was a defective product, now this was my Second purchase, I was thinking this one would be good. But the headphone jack doesn't fit into it, the volume buttons don't work as you can see in the video. Very loosely connected. Fed up by this service. Never gonna purchase any electronic from Amazon."
"I had already bought a boat bass heads 242 headphones which is red colored but the cable is of worser quality it started to damage even i handled with more care, so this time i ordered headphone with stretch free cable though i don't like the colour but i don't want to compromise the amazing sound quality of boat bass heads.hope this time the cable withstands ."
"I have been using the earphones for quite a while now and something you notice is that the earwax get stuck near the speakers. When you try tk clear the earwax the mesh can come out , otherwise everything is fine."
its doesn't work after just 2 months same happen with my previous ear phone and if u go for replacement then the model is not there u have to wait for another 5- 7 days and one more thing have time for 1-2 hrs for service center visit ...becoz crowd is more and the staff is only one.....worst quality and service by boat...try another good brand..
I this is my 3rd boat headfones. I love the product.but this time i am amazed to see i receved a nice black color pouch to keep my headfones... i was very happy but soon i realized that the manufacturers has forgoten to test the pouch...test means actully fold n place it inside the tiny little pouch. Tats disapponting.
"Its good, if you are want it to just use for calls. If you are a music lover then go for Ptron, JBL or Philips. This one is loud and clear but Bass is not that good. It hurts ear after sometime as the voice is so acoustic while listening to Music."
The sound clarity and quality is really nice.. One drawback is the ear buds are getting dettached frequently and its not much sturdy.. Otherwise its good to use.. Noise cancellation is also good..
Dont buy BOAT product...go for some other company.... As warranty doesnt matters in boat... If problem rises with the product...they arranges for the pick up from your home but then the product never returns .. Nor there customer care responds .. Even there website doesnt update the status of product .. I m struggling  since 1 month to get my product back ... And yes the mic got damaged soon ...
"My experienceIf you wanted to jog and listen to music this may be a better product. It will never fell off your ears. I use primarily for office call & watch movies. Its was not a good fit. The person in other side of conference most of the time complain about the background noises. My primary issue was with the mic, never had a issue with hearing any sounds both on call & while watching movies."
"The box and freebies might look attractive to any buyer to conceals the flaws of the product. Firstly the boat seal was broken before handing over to me. Secondly the mic with buttons provided didn't function at all, even after restarting the phone and trying with other devices. None the less it wasn't compatible with my phone (Galaxy M51)."
This was my first Experience of boat headphones Right now I'm listening song and i writing this review I say guy's It's amazing😍 headphones bass 5 ⭐ and also You guy's Listen evey details of 🔊sound Amazing At this prize I say Go For this highly recommended to all
"I have purchased 163, 225 and 242 bassheads. Sound and quality is worth of buying. However there is issue in plunging the 3.5mm jack in all of three earphones and it impacts the sound also if it got misplace even after a very lite shake of mobile. So buy on your risk whether it's compatible to your mobile."
"I was using realms buds 2 and unfortunately lost them while traveling somewhere so while ordering for new pair I thought of trying these but to my disappointment they don't sound good at all when compared to the buds 2, neither in bass nor treble. To my bad luck i didnt check but no option of return available, only replacement, i guess I'll have to order a new fresh order."
"HelloThere is issue in Ear phone , Whenever i calling with Earphone , call is getting auto disconnect due to Loose Vire connection ,  Ear phone Plug is not working proper , Earphone after attaching into mobile ,  Call auto diconnect and auto music start due to little movement of earphone.I am not happy with this earphone , i have used this only for one month and getting issue.Replace this earphone ASAP."
I have received this product on 17th august 2020. It looks good but the product quality is very bad. while speaking or listening to music it gives the buzzing noise. while stopping speaking or music the noise also stopped. I am totally disappointed with this product. I am immediately raising the complaint and make it a return.
"I Really liked it, Aound quality Fentastic clear sound, till now this is the Best Earphones i have uaed that too under Rs.500 Value for money, with this earphones extra two sets of ear buds came, firstly not fit well with Defalut earbuds, but sound quality gud later i changed another earbuds set then i felt awesome experience fits well So, change ur ear buds according to ur ear size for great experience, Thanq amazon n Boat242..."
"It's ok ok type not a great sound quality, I was using monster earphone that cost me around INR 1500 where sound quality was awesome, look wise it's classy and seem sturdy but sound is quiet loud and not soft as expected. I like soft sounds like Bose, JBL. Ok if budget is INR 500."
"Nice headphone colour may vary slightly from the page,wire bulit quality and sound,bass everything ies awesome.The box contains:1-Earphone, 1 year warranty card,extra ear tips one clip and a leaflet... Packing quality some what poor..."
Totally waste of money I bought this ear phone on 22nd Jan 2021 na now(in the month of June) it's not working. One side of the ear phone drop dead n other works very low plus the earphone is making disturbing noises. Don't ever buy this phone. I like to claim my warrenty it will be a great help if amazon help me out with the process.
"I cant hear sound from left side of it, and the return and exchange offer was only for till 7 August and I found problem in it on 12 August, there is no boat showroom near me. Please exchange it if possible. 😓"
I bought them in October 2020 and it's march 2022 but still earphones are fantastic (sound and bass) absolutely perfectI have noticed other earphones sound gets degraded over a period of time but these are beyond perfect
"I am using it from around 3 months. All I would say is it is worth its price. Value for money. It looks so cool, stylish as the design is very creative and attractive. Durability is very good as its perfomance is same as it was before 3 months, no issues till now. Sound quality is perfect. Noice cancellation also works well. Only issue is it gets tangled."
"I have using this for 30 days .. I have a problem in bass , it doesn't support 8D sounds , even my 200rs earphones does !  I can experience only a normal audio.. and also the left earphone was low compared to right ..."
"Never expected that BOAT would give us such a Bad product. Pricing is not cheap, but the quality is very poor. Within a month or so the product quality deteriorated. The Sound Quality is poor, music gets cut intermittently. Poor product. Not a value for our Money"
"The earphone is good for calls and decent for music.If you are music lover, go for Sennheiser CX 80.Liked the build quality as it feels strong with clip, mic and volume controls provided.Overall i am happy for the product i got, for the price i paid."
Worst product ever ... its sound quality is very bad and some time only one earpiece is working and even its not comfortable in ears and something is wrong with the mic its not working ..dont go for this product .. amazon should give me option to order some different product as i exchanged it once and the same problem is there .. i want some different product ..
"I used them for quite long time andSound Quality is good butDurability is average, the wire get stretched easily, A simple can lead to not working of your earphone.But I get them replaced with a great service of the company.(You just need to go to there website and register your complain with the product invoice.. they will pick your product at your door step)But the mice of the replaced product stopped working after some time."
Useless now. I have bought three different pairs of this product in last eight months but quality of Boat is not as good as it used to be.All three stopped working in 3 to 4 months span.
Not good its  local brand you pepole given me this is not orignal boat 242 this is local earphone no bass incresing volume than no bass also clear i used before boat 200 that's i got orignal this is not original ok so i return this
"The bass quality is bad, due to high treble is quite high and due to this unable to hear voice with clarity.Ok for the price but wouldnt recommend for others based on my experience."
"It's better than many that I have used far. Mic is something far better than other brands. I am using for office calls and working great for me, no one complain of low voice"
It works fine and good for 6-8 months...I have purchased almost 3-4 pieces from past 2-3 years... After using it for 6-8 months either the left earphone stops working or else the right one similarly....If you're looking for earphones for less than 1 year life and not too costly... Go for this...
"These earphones have a legit bass driver and can deliver a clear and balanced output. They might not be the most comfortable ones due to a cheeky design attempt by the ""BOAT Team"" who for some reason could not keep it simple. Maybe they were supposed to look cool or something. Still if you listen to music for like about 2 hours a day then you could go for these. However, If you are an extreme audiophile and have your earphones plugged in for the major part of the day then these are not for you."
It is the best one and the most stylish looking.Here are some pros and consproIt is very useful for online classes as the quality and noise cancellation is awesome.It has a very beautiful design.ConA Bit uncomfortable maybe???Result:-You can buy it(Review after 8 months)
Been using them for some while now and while WFH and couple of kids around they have proven to be effective. Noise cancellation is not that great but they do help say about 70%
The product looks cheap with that design unlike how it looks in images. The cord/cable/wire is semi strong unlike it's competitors.Bass is ok. Not recommended if you are someone who likes soft music.Go for 255 it's atill the best!Had Terrible experience with Amazon for getting it refunded!
I have boat rockerz 510 and boat bassheads 225 as well but i needed one more so i ordered this boat bassheads 242..In terms of audio quality i am very much impressed.But in terms of build quality it is far behind than boat 225 and microphone performance is also poor.Button also does not work sometimes. But pricing is value for money.
I got the product in offer at prize of ~380₹ so its Best with this prize. Boat is always known for sound quality so I got the same experience. Also Ear ergonomics is best suited and tight.
"It was ok for a week or we are unable to identify the noise issue, it started giving abnormal noise once connected to phone, quite unhappy now the return period is also over need to live with it or scrap it"
"The sound quality very imbalanced and not good at all. But should I complain, it does what its name says... makes you a ""bass head"". The mic is not up to the mark either, I have to constantly hold it in front my mouth and if its just dangling, the other person gets noise and can't hear me at all. Even ears start paining even after half an hour of use."
"Sound quality is good. Noise cancellation feature is also good.Earphone filter quality is bad. it'll remove after sometimes.Two times i replaced my earphone due to internal wire problem.wire quality is also an issue.  one time left side earphone not worked and this time mic issue.only reason i purchased this, brand name and sound quality."
Not very impressive - in picture it appears very good but the physical product is NOT IMPRESSIVE. It's upto you to buy or NOT. I DON'T LIKE THIS EAR PHONES. I WILL RETURN THIS PRODUCT.
"Sound quality, noise cancellation, base is good but but, what is the purpose of this if your headphones got defecated within 2month. I bought it in 1week of Jan and in the end of Feb it got defecated. Just waste of money."
"Waste of money!!I was expecting good quality product but the mic of the earphone has stopped working just in few days.. May be after a month of using, Even when i was not using this earphones much.. 😡"
I am happy with the earphone design as it just fits right into my ears. I am sad about the quality of plastic that is used as a little piece chipped off within 1 week of use.I don't know how other earphones are as these are the most expensive earphones I have purchases/used. I feel that the microphone isn't that great it has a bit of static noise and sometime the music plays too loudly.
Good product..and sound qlty...but will be better it would have a gold plated or L shaped pin...not perfectly fit on my mi note 10 pros 3.5 mm jack...some times it's become loos from port.
"Value for Money. Punchy bass, balanced mid, trebles. Clear telephonic conversations.Happy with the price vs. quality aspx.  Recommended buy."
After couple of years purchase i'm still using the same earphone. i have bought so many headphones but this is stunning in buid quality or everything like sound quality etc.
"It's very bad that the mic is always getting fault, this is my second headset in the same brand facing the same issue on both. Claiming a warranty is a very tedious process, I have been trying to reach the support team but they have closed my ticket without solving my issue. Worst experience ever with this product."
"See main thing is overall product is pretty nice and durable. It's good looking and the design is attractive. But the sound quality is not up to the mark. The sound quality is really good while playing games. But during video calls it isn't that clear. Noise cancelation is standard, equal to the earphones of this category and is pretty cool in accordance to price. Bass quality is awesome. No problem at all in any type of music."
"Sound quality is good. 3.5 mm pin is NOT angular. Had it been angular say with 90 degree, it would have been more convenient to use. Cannot comment right now on durability of cable. Overall product is good."
The earphone stops working after few days. Replacement service is excellent. But even after replacement the earphone stops working. Waste of money since 2 ear phone stopped working in single purchase. I didn't even replace the 2nd replacement since I am sure the 3rd one will not work
"The boat Bassheads 242 in-Ear Wired Earphones is good, only one defect which I found was that the earplug holder comes out once in a while, but can be fixed. rest all are good, good product at this price. I recommend"
"Pathetic customer service, i have sent emailWith details for both boat earphone and both defective with invoice .It is almost 2 weeks and no response .It said 1 year warranty and weird sound coming ."
Everything is just amazing if u really wanna buy a wired best quality and premium feel earphones then go for it1) bass is little bid low but on 100% vol sometimes u can feel vibrations2) sound is crystal clear i love it3) gives premium feel4) with 3 different earbud fittingsAND IT IS A GENUINE REVIEWGO FOR ITboAt 242Defiantly u will love it
Bought it for 399 rs. Almost one year passed and it is still fine and working. Sound is also good with quality bass. The most important thing is it does not breaks like other earphones.
"Best product in this range.Below 1000 earphone range BOAT  is the best product in this range. Well balanced sound. Nice bass. I really like the bass quality of this earphone. Before this i used BOAT 225. But aft using this I literally like this earphone.One more plus point for boat service.They have better customer service then anyother brand. #cheapMivi service, don't go for mivi you will disappoint with thier service. Boat is best In all way."
"First of all bulid quality is superb having braded cable which is good , crystal clear sound and also good bass at this price range.. The good thing is having inline microphone which is amazing.. Overall experience from the boAt as always"
"Better at this price range comparison to othr brands , I was using JBLs earphones which were of rs 1199 and this is better than that too. Of course build quality of front wires is bit cheaper."
"Sound quality is good.Clip available for easy handling, while taking calls.Bass is good, felt little unrealistic.Cons:Ear fitting is not that good."
I have been using it for three months and now it doesn't play audio out of one ear .the build quality is very poor that the wires are already  broken and been pulled out from the head. they provide a warranty period of one year but unfortunately I lost the warranty card now I seriously have no idea what to do with it. A reputed brand like boat shouldn't manufacture these kind of cheap quality product and ruin its prominence.
"The great product from boat and amazon. this is the best product under 600 I like this product,the bass quality is 90,sound quality is 100,and noise concellation is 95.I am using this product from 2 months my experience is too much good 👍"
Not a good quality products.Amazon delivery is awesone. Also amazon is taking care of good product but sorry to say the seller delivered bad quality product again.Not recommended.Wire is not tangle free alsp there is some problem in earphones as well.
Used it for more than a year.The quality is great and crisp. It has less bass as compared to basehead 225 but definitely takes upper hand in noise cancellation and quality.Trust me guyz you will love this one.Obviously better than basehead 225.(just a little less bass as compared to 225.But you wont even need that bass because the sound quality is that good).
"yes this product is very good for listening 🎧 while running , traveling and many other thingsplease buy this product or you'll be regret laterCYA Pal"
I bought this after seeing all postive reviews. But the headset is not up to the level. Ear buds are hurting and it's not comfortable for me.Sound quality got changed after using 2days.Bass is too bad.I will not recommend Boat product for anyone. They need to improve on earbuds and fittings comfortable.I'm returning this product.
1st it was cancelled and got to know that it was damaged on the way but got another one within 4 working days... to deliver in kashmir so early.Its best earphone as i ordered 2.nice soundbest noise cancellationgood designI dont like earbuds as it has...it has a premium look
Quick delivery and best service.Product is suler amazing just tried some bass songs and the bass is too much boAt never disappoints in that. This is quite great deal in this range if you are looking for a wired earphone. Go for it.
After almost 30 days of use I can say that this earphone is very confortable for the ears even after hours of usage. The microphone may not be the best in capruring voice and at times there is flickering voice in some devices. but the speakers offer satisfactory sound quality for listening to music or videos
The only thing about wired headphones I don't like is it's not that durable !. My bassheads only worked for 2 months after buying the product . I'm not satisfied with the price of something like this if it's not so durable . 2 months later one of the ear bud weren't working and mic too.
"I have purchased this earphones with the hope that it will be durable as their Marketing team claimed it to be durable. After few months of use suddenly it broke from connector side and it stopped working. Cheap quality materials are used to make it seem like durable. Never buy earphones from Boat, cheap chinese built products!!!"
"Everything is okay, not much expected, but i am really scared that this won't work for a long time because the earphones I received, the jack which you insert in the phone THAT WAS A BIT BENDED and that's the most reason all the earphones get damage. Let's see hope for the best, and yeah the bass was over very much, bass in these earphones are filled like garbage XD. As usual not much expected. "" So Far So GOOD. :)"
"The base quality is awesome. Once you plug in the head phones, you won't be able to hear the outside noise. It has a good sound quality and I love this one"
"Great for running and never fall , but worst part is the mic is inthe centre of the right side of the wire..that's irritate u when u run with this.Don't buy if u r music lover"
The earphones are going smooth till now 1 week passed and till now no issue came by these earphones sound quality is Nice VERY useful for sports loving persons VERY comfortable and strong earphones but one thing is bad in this your ear will start paining if you will be going to use these for more then 3-4 hours just because the earphones manage itself like that no air or no outer sound comes in our ear and only the inner sound comes which leads to pain in our ears . Rest all the things are fine till now .Thank you .
In 350-400 bucks it's a great product with nice sound quality and viuce control on the earphone makes it easy to up down sound without taking out mobile.
"They cheating to buy the product ,I can buy boat basshead 242 red colour, the cable is worst worst worst 😡😡 quantity, they said to, we will build superior cables but that is fake fake fake 💢😡🌡️,so don't buy this product, the another option  you can buy  realme air buds2 it's  100 times better then boat, boat always bot😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡"
"I bought this for Rs 449 in the Dussehra sale..It has high base and is pretty sturdyYou get a free pouch for the earphones and also a pair of extra coversThe sound quality is really goodThe bass is highIt seems sturdy as of nowAt the highest volume, the noise cancellation is pretty apparentTo sum up, it's a value for money product"
"The worst decision of my life to purchase this item, and another thing is the worst customer service by boat company who not at all listening of their customers (can find many complaints against it in Google) Mr Smit Kadam from boat company is the DEVIL of all. DON'T PURCHASE ANY OF BOAT PRODUCTS, YOU WILL REGRET LATER IF YOU PURCHASED IT."
Audio is good quality. Bass is little low. Looks sturdy.Build quality is bad. 1 speaker cover got popped out and I need to use fevi quick to fit it again tightly.
"Like:-- Portable-- wires don't tangle much-- fits in the ear-- since wired, no worries on the charge being worn out.Dislike:-- hurts the ears sometimes due to the size"
As usual boAt has delivered a great product. The noise cancellation is great. The mic works perfectly. There is controls for pause/play and volume. The cables seems well protected but will know if its as effective as the flat cables after longer usage. The look of the earphones is also stylish. Proud to continue as a basshead!
"Received a used earphone , disappointed  and they did not work properly as well they got disconnected quite ofter while connected to the phone rhe music stopped playing."
As soon as u plugin the earphones one thing which U realize is that treble is good but as far as bass is concerned it is nowhere. At High volumes it has much of a noise so suitable for lower volumes. The design is peppy and eye catching however can't say too comfortable. Overall an average performing device
good product n but it started to have a problem of no sound in one earphone then when you adjust the jack then works it was fine till 2 days then started having this problem not great for this much price the jbl one is the same price and the overall quality sound everything is just perfect I say don't buy BoAt products this my 2nd BoAt product and I'm not at all satisfied :(
"Thought I could have taken an expensive headphones but I wanted a sturdy Earphones and I got the best product. It's sturdy with good sound quality and works well with all kind of phones and laptops. Excellent product in less price.It's comfortable for ears, ears don't pain if you use it for continuous 4 hrs as well."
"these earphones have a lot of issues.first, the volume range in which they effectively work is quite small. outside that the sound quality drops drastically.then, they have a weird background buzz like old earphones used to have. like old earphones, these make noise even when we scroll mouse.the mic isn't that good.earphones are uncomfortable."
"Good sound quality but not so comfortable inside ears. Not for long period of use.Update: product stopped working within 2 months or so had mic and Jack issues, sent for replacement but of no use it's been 23 days the replacement unit has not been dispatched. The customer care is unprofessional and has no updates regarding when the product will be dispatched, they don't register complaints.Overall do not buy the life is less and after sales is worst you will ever see."
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
" Sound the quality  is amazing , it's just the design of the earbud is bit uncomfortable, as boats 225 fit perfectly in ears. The noise cancelation is good, even over the calls.I had issue only with the packing of the product. At first I felt someone has already opened it and used."
it is a nice product to serve the intended purpose. i recd in good proper packaging. the ear bud fits into ear for proper noise cancellation. The sound is clear.
"Best earphones in this range, Main thing about boat is it's service, unlike other companies if your earphones stops working they will pick earphones from your home and deliver new earphones within few days (if it's under one year warranty)!!!!..."
"Sounds great, mic is good, buttons are really clicky which is good but, there's a big BUT, the noise cancellers on the top of each bud are so hard that they make your ear lobes ache during long usage.Small Solution: you can exchange the noise cancellers, switching the right one for the left one and vice versa. This will minimize the pain till you get used to it."
"I purchased the bassheads 242 based on the good sound quality of boats bassheads 100. I am however disappointed by this purchase. Not just is the 242 four times the price, the material and sound quality is lacking. I wish I could return these."
I am coming from boat 225 and trust me this is really an upgrade to it every problem in 225 has been fixed....its angled fitting is the best....max volume is very loud......bass is too good just one thing this is bang for a buck just get it over any other earhone blindly and u will not regret honestly
Stopped working after one month.i sent to boat for warranty purpose never got my product back.they never respond to calls or emails.it's been a year now.i have stopped contacting them.worst product and service ever
Awesome for the price.It's  sounds like it had a separate driver for bass a subwoofer. 👍It's very clear too mean s mids and he highs arre very much clear.
"Sound quality is good, although sometimes it may feel unbalanced. Not satisfied with the build quality though, the right earpiece's red colored attachment came out with little to no rough usage within one month. Think before you buy, realme buds 2 provide you better build quality and overall sound with just Rs.100/- more. Hope this helps you :)"
"The worst earpiece i have bought so far.Honestly after looking the reviews,i was hoping it would be fine.but the sound was soo...unclear and it makes the music worst.Therefore, the sound quality is worst while others are fine .Its just a waste of money comparing to the product.A 100 worth chinese earpiece gives more good sound than this product.please dont buy it.U will regret."

 Only the colour is better.Rest nothing is good about this product..Sound Quality is just ok.Noise cancellation is also just ok..but bass..only its name is bassheads 242..I was expecting it as its name but it totally disappointed me.So I got it today and I am returning it in the same day.
I used this earphone for around 6 months and one earpiece is not working nowAlthough I have claimed warranty but it takes and also it's fit didn't suited meYou may have better options than itBuy it at you own wish
"I purchased these on a discount from Amazon. The best part is fitting and noise cancellation. Fits so well that you can easily wear during sports, walking etc. Due to noise cancellation you can enjoy the music and go on in a different world. Very happy with this purchase."
"If u are going for this earphone you are comprimising with quality , You will get good audio , nice look , but  after 3months of roughly use, It will start breaking from  everywhere . This earphone is weak and Im saying this from my experience.Go for another earphones of boat or any other brand"
"Guys, believe me you are gonna having permanent headache and ear pain by this earphone.its sound quality is like hell. you cant hear the actual voice, background sound overlap actual one.specially if you talk with someone always get some background noise mixed with caller voice. 👎👎don't believe on positive reviews you will regret.."
"Overall sound quality is excellent...you can here the bass & treble ... Mic. Works perfectly with clearity. Volume up & down keys and ⏯️ button are tactile, light weight headphones with sturdy cables. Just go for it."
Okay-ish overal. Has some issues in capturing voice correctly but does the work on a decent level. The voice clarity is not so great in calls. . YouTube audio is weird sometimes. But okay overall
My first experience with boat. Mic is just so bad compared to a local earbud except that sound quality is there.Somethimes there is audio jack loose connection with mobile
"Awesome clarity. You can here every background notes.. Very happy with this.You can hear many background sounds. its a beast. i have sony, scenihizer, other best brands. but this is awesome."
With this price there are better options . It's been just a month since I started using this earphones .  Noisy line type of sound is produced whenever there is movement in the microphone . It's really irritating . This sound is audible from both ends soo it hampers the conversation .
"I bought it for Rs 399,, After using for 3 days,I found it very good in below things,,, bass quality is good,build quality is good,doesnt look cheap material used is also good,sound quality,fit to ear easily and comfortable,cable is strong and coated with a tough but soft transparent materialSoft ear holding shape helps alotIn one word- U can go with this if want a cheap but durable earphone"
Sound is excellent. This is the only headset that you will get with volume controls/song track contols in this price range. It also comes with a pouch and clip manger. The products with volume controls are much costlier. Go for it.
"Good Bass quality , mid range and vocals are clear , snug fit and a pouch to carryBut wife Is not that grate for rough use , it may get damaged soon if used hardly"
I have ordered this earphones on Saturday (22-01-2022) and yesterday (23-01-2022) it have came delivery was fast and with in time.This earphones are best I have used it for full day and it have great bass. The color is also very good Thanks for boat provide a good budget earphones. And thanks to the amazon for fast delivery
In 3 days it's one side is lower in sound. Quality of this product isn't satisfactory at all. This I didn't aspect from brand like boat. I have used boat headhone previously but this time I have been really disappointed by this .
Built quite very low gread. After 3 month usage bass as well as volume intensity decrease which make sound quality the worst among this price range segment. In addition After service of boAt is very unresponsive. If think about warranty claim than it not work( they denied your request and don't even respond your mail and call so you helpless). Customer care number are only for show off not single one of them working.
Chinese product with sub standard voice quality. The hooks fit well and option to change track is also there but the sound quality is not up to the mark. I was surprised to see such high rating but i think people have rated because of price which as per the sound quality is still too much
Loved it and was able to buy one more. But hardly 1.5 months and the two earplugs popped off from the joint of the two connecting into a single wire. Really sad to see it just pop off while attending a call.
1) Good bass2) Clear and crisp audio3) Phenomenally fits in the ear  I have Boat airdopes 621 which is around  RS. 2000 and the fit of this RS. 400 earphones are  uncomparably good.
I have purchased this head phone 3 months ago and now it is not working so when I went to service station they are not ready for replace the product. Very bad experience of service center and this head phone. Even so many people are there for replace only their headphones.
I felt little more bass should be there..of course depends on mobile also.i used on redmi 9 pro may be if we adjust Equalizer help. Super clarity on calls...
Buy it if you love bass.The sound quality is pretty good.The clips are harmless.Causes a bit of pain during the initial days but you'll get used to it.sometimes the bass overweighs the vocal quality but it doesn't seem as an issue as we can adjust it with the help of equaliser.The mic is doing a great job.Produces a great sound by the way.Its more than enough if you keep the volume to 70%...All around good earphones but I would still recommend you to buy JBL for better quality..
"Good sound in this price range. Using it from ladt 6 months. Looks great, good bass, clarity of sound may not meet your expectations on high volume.Good for PUBG or movies.Not recommended for long time use."
Well it's really a great product.But if u have habit to put wire in ur mouth then idk how but the wire changes colour from black to white.Overall the are good. For more good quality u might need to adjust your phone sound settings.Bass is good in this price.Comfort is ok not that much good but it wont be a problem with time.You can remove ear hooks according to ur comfort.
As been said by my friend he liked this headphone very much but it's noice cancelation in not bad but I will give 4 stars because earphones don't have better noice cancelation then headphones.I will personally will suggest you to buy headphones.
I received this product today but the volume control in the head set it's not working. Increase button is working decreasing volume button is not working. I'm in need of head set. If I replace again it will take twenty days to get the head set. But sound quality is good. Pouch is cute.
Functioning of product is not good..without any physical damage right side ear phone suddenly stopped functioning..Is this problem may cover in warranty? or else we can consider this is a prototype item..
Don't buy this product.this is the worst quality.sound quality is good but it won't last long.the wire was very thin.i received the damaged product after using this couple of days one side of earphone is not working..😒 this is the 3rd time same happens with the boat company.i decided to quit from buying this company products..very unsatisfied..👎
"This has the best audio quality among all other earphones under ₹400. The bass is not too high and just perfect. The band is a bit sticky and may get tangled, but the sound quality more than makes up for it. Overall, very happy with the product."
Writing this review after 4 months of minimum use. The Earphone has stopped working. I am so pissed at BOAT for selling this garbage.
This is very good headset. I used for more than 2 weeks now and writing the review.So far I have never faced any disturbance whiile attending my office call. Audio is very clear .
Great product but as every boat earphones I've bought last  only like 4 to 6 month after which either one side stops working and all never buying boat ever again. This is like my third one from boat
"I like the product. It is worth for the price I paid. Previously I was using mi headset in this price range, since i am using it for a year , I changed to this product, I dont feel much bass and sound quality, i think it is because i am using MOTO.I should try in some other mobiles in order to check the sound quality.Previously I was dissatisfied with amazon for providing wrong product, But now they delivered it on correct time and correct product.I would like to suggest amazon to make their app more user friendly like flipkartThanks."
Please don't not buy this product atleast from Amazon. I have never faced this issue from other websites from this product stopped working and getting weird noises in between any music or call. My music audio volume automatically increase and decrease due to this cheap product. It's just 3 months ago I bought this product. Really frustrates to any customer.
"Been using this for a month. I know it's not a long time but so far it's great. One thing I don't like is the shape of the earpiece. You can't just normally insert that thing in your ear. It requires a few couple seconds of fidgeting, each ear, in order for it to properly sit in your ear"
"I will not bore you with a long review. In short, the sound quality and bass quality is so good that it will compensate for any other demerits you might find about the earphones.Although, I don't think there are any significant cons considering its cost and quality. Fit and comfort is also perfect. Surprisingly, the wings are also useful."
"All over good product....I was worried about my product because of the bad reviews of users,But I didn't find any of wrong . I've been using for 4hrs continuously but nothing bad experience. Go for it 😅. I'm a telecalling executive so I need to use all day. If anything bad happened I'll let u know 🙂 Don't worry 🤠."
These earphones are very good. i am using boat aordopes but so much background noise comes during call. But these earphones are better than airdopes. Go for it. I am using it for my online classes from last 1 month.
"It works. It has high bass but other than that nothing. Sound quality is not good, do except it to be good while hearing instrumental songs. It is comfortable for wearing but its base will make your ear ache in long time use"
Bought this and was just able to use for few days as my son brok my new earphone still loved to use as the volume and sound is prity clear and good specially the bass.
It's good but the voice quality is much better at similar models... Moreover the ear attachment that's given is quite painful if worn for long hours...
"Why this earphone is Awesome ?- Amazing Sound & Bass (Needless to say it cancels noise, duh!)- Fitting so perfect you will hop with joy (And still it won't get off ur ears)- Cool looks (looks cool)- Value for money (Even though i got it as a Gift)"
"I bought 2 of these at a 1 week interval. The first one, for my friend, produces static noise everytime the jack is turned and also, the microphone is not working when connected to a laptop. But the one I bought for myself later after 1 week, works well. I guess I'm.both satisfied and disappointed at the same time."
"I have been using these earphones with my Moto e⁷ Power Android 10 version for the past one month. The sound quality, noise cancellation and bass results are superb. I am fully satisfied with the product because it feels fantastic when one using it. In my view, it's a good value for the price paid."
"Clearly I expected a much better product.  The earpiece is a misfit, the wire 'tangle-friendly', and the sound just ordinary.  Time to move to another brand."
It worked absolutely gine for first 6 months but due to normal wear and tear and of course rough use one side stopped working But amazing service from boat Even the earphone was little damaged they instantly replaced it with new refurbished peice. And that what makes boat goodAnd of course sound is excellentSo go for it.

 Nice  product. Noise cancellation is good. I have recorded my voice on the mobile with this product found the distinguish difference with other earphones.I am sure it is  A GOOD ONE..!
"were a little overpriced at 550/-, sound is very clear loud, build is of great quality, I removed ear hooks , they were slightly irritating - personal preference I guess, needed attachment clip and it fulfills. great at this price though and best if you can them for 400-450/- in sale"
"Waooo durable for music lover, bass is out standing, build quality is great, m highly recommended thanks Amazon team and seller,"
Worst headphones ever. I gave good stars because initially they worked really good. I ordered these on 25th February and they literally stopped working in March. Worst worst worst!!!!!! Please do not waste your money on these boat headphones... I ordered two and both of them stopped working within a month.
"For a person who uses earphones almost 24/7 , it is really comfortable. sometimes i even forgot i was wearing it cuz usually if we wear any ear phones for a long time it will eventually lead to some discomfort but in this case , there is nothing of such sort. i would really love to talk its beautiful color, I am a neon lover and i fell in love the moment i saw it . If you are a neon lover and wants some color instead of the basic black ones, then go for this one"
"Not a good product, for 1st 3 months the headphones was working superb after then one of the earpiece stopped working...had read mixed comments about this product, so was confused to buy or not, but disappointed with this product"
"I love the design, though its made of plastic, ita very comfortable abd looks sturdy, theres just 1 thing, the sound quality of boat 552 is better than this, but 552 are really uncomfortable, well.... theres always a catch! Love both of the earphones, for better quality goo for 552, for much more comfort go for these ones"
"Worst earphones I ever buyedsound quality is worst than bass100when I plug the earphone in my Samsung galaxy .earphone start to make noise (aazzzhhhaaaahhhzzzz) and then i have to rotate my earphone jack which is plugged to see which angle is giving proper sound.go for basshead 100 ,thank me later"
"Using it for 5 months and its working fine, noise cancellation is bad, paint coming of from the hard plastic parts, rubber year hooks are good, wire is fine, clip and ear cushions are also good.Buttons working fine."
"I purchased this product in Mar 2020. After the use of 4 months it stopped working. Being a 1 year warranty I applied for replacement to the boat. BOAT refused to replace and state that ""Your Invoice is Invalid"" This is very ridiculous that Invoice generated by AMAZON declared Invalid.  Friends Please don't buy product from BOAT ."
"I reallyyy lyk this earphone,Fitting perfectlySound quality superbColour is amazingSuper BassEverything guuuuud for this prize 👏🏼❤️"
Worst product I have ever seen first I bought it and replaced it again the problem has occurred over noise in the headphones if I turn the jack the noise is coming pls don't buy this product for its price
"The earphones have good sound quality, fit comfortably inside your ears, and stay there even if there's sweating, and never caused any irritation even after 3-4 hours of continuous use. So far so good. But after about 6 months my worst fears came true and sound stopped coming out of the right earpiece. Do yourself a favour, and buy something else."
"I was looking for midrange earphones from quite sometime for my workouts and running .but this piece of earphone is upto my mark asIt is perfectly grip in my ears no fear of falling while running,Clear and metallic soundGood bass ,Look wise it is awesome.But I am not satisfied 15 days thes earphone maic not work properly I hav unsatisfied"
"In this price didn't expected to have this good sound quality. It has quality like of Sony or Sennheiser earphones. Good bass, isloates music from ambience noise. Not active sound cancellation feature but quality rubber of earbuds makes possible."
"We know that the earphones always tangles,  in this they have solved the issues, and the quality of the bass is great. I recommend to buy this for my besties too."
"The quality is very average but the packing was good though.It seems to be useful for taking calls and day to day stuff, If your a music lover definitely i wont recommend this product.The mic seems to good."
"the bass of the sound is good when I turn the volume to the fullest, but the other pitched tune rather than the bass are unbearable. The treble is too much and the sound gets cranky as I turn the volume High. They are good only to listen bass music and notes. If your planning to buy this product for gaming purpose please don't buy this product can't bear the noise"
This headphone is excellent in terms of the sound quality and bass particularly when listening to music in youtube etc.. The build quality is very good and its perfectly fit the ear. However I found that quality of the microphone is poor based on the feedback from the receivers end.
"Although sound quality is damn good but i personally can't use it for hours of music listening and gaming,it starts hurting my ears after an hour or few. The wires get easily untangled as much i have found.If you are a regular user for earphones, i would not recommend this but if you are an occasional user this is worth the price."
I got damage product.I increase and decrease volume by its own automatically..It suddenly increased vol to High it got hurt to my ears..I am going to complaint this to the community that dont ever buy this product .I wish this company goes in loss.i hate it.
"Overall it's a gud headset with a more than decent sound quality. However , keep the volume somewhere at 70 % it will give u awesome experience.I am die hard JBL user and must say these headset are beyond expectations neck to neck with JBL signature ... Nice one"
"They've the best grip , the best bass , and the best microphone u can ever get from an earphone in this budget , it's loud and clear and the microphone being at the right earphone makes it closer to ur mouth which gives a better clearity of ur voiceThe bass is too good for a mobile user and me being a student who has class and plays and listens to songs on an earphone, I loved these"
Using BOat earphones for 3 years now and this one Ive been using for 8 months now and got no issues in sounds or wire or anything..even though i use earphones wildly like ive been using it with my pc phone and lappy but no issues at all. Other earphones dont survive like this one with my usage pattern even the bassheads 225.
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
" Okay...so in these earphones, u can get a loud volume as prooved in the vid...Build quality is a 9/10.Sound would be a 10/10Bass is a bit average but the sound makes up for it ... If i were to rate it it'll be a 7/10.."
But the volume increase and decrease buttons are not working properly when i pressing the volume up then it pauses the song and when i pauseing the song then volume is decreases please help for this boat
I brought this earphone 2 months before... With in a month of use my earphone I was having problems.... I applied for warrenty.... I got replaced by same other piece... But still the problem was not solved... Still I am facing the same problem..... Have to claim warrenty again
The product is quite nice not comfortable to ear but sound is nice. I guess it will be having a durability issue because the wires are very thin easily can break. Use carefully.
"Hi Team, I got delivery of this head phones on 7th July, but on 26th July MIC stopped working.....not even 1 month of use. INR 500 + gone in vain. I already have boats head which are perfectly working.. Can I expect a reply on this issue."
Bought after reviewing amazon rating but now disappointed as I didn't find it suitable for my ears due it's weird design.It's wire entangles everytime.Overll a hyped produced by boat.
It's a wonderful headphone of you think in terms of durability. My headphones was rolled up in my shirt pocket when i meet in a bike accident. On impact it was only scraped but the audio still worked as normal. The sound quality is not great but average for the price range. Overall a great to recommend.
"Best for bass lovers, built quality is decent enough for the price but they could've done better the glossy plastic case kind of feels cheap and gets scratches and the jack could've been a l-shaped one which ruins their pretty tough rugged wire claim vain.Verdict - at this price point it is the best you can get but they could've done better"
I tried to get best wired inear buds by boat. There is no other model superior to these. Apple user can't use these!
"you cannot expect more from this price range,the jbl or other earphones do offer the same build quality.The sound is good..base is good as well,the rubber support works well.Wire length is unexpectedly long .If you are looking in something for the price range of 500 or 600 this works well and compared to other products of this range,this js somewhat similar in sound build quality, although the music is satisfactory ,highs and lows are clear enough to enjoy any song."
Entirely braided with kevlar this earphone comes with a aluminium/stainless stell mesh.It is totally tangle free in most of the situations.Carry pouch felt a little smaller for its accomodation.It works as a charm on my Xiaomi Poco X3😎.Well pronounced trebles and extremely high bass (more than realme buds 2 even after 10 mm drivers).Dolby Atmos adds the difference!
"The product i ordered was orange but i have got yellow colour earphone, yellow earphone also looks good. Plastic quality is average the function buttons does'nt work on laptop but they work better in mobile phone. The earphone fits in ear so comfortably . I think if boat will give metal body for earphone they will be no. Seller"
"My opinion is bass quality is little bit poor, switch qulity and bulid qulity is super, and also the carrying bag,sound qulity is good, it is loud ,and noise cancellation is good, wire toggle is little bit difficult when using"
Feels comfortable (atleast for me)Good bassHigh volume ( gives nice control over hearing)Straight pin with small dia cover (properly fits in almost all type of cover/cases)Nice price point.
Looks fine...not so comfortable for my ears..bass is a bit on the lower side..quality of the earbuds could have been better...call quality is good..you wouldn't feel the thump..bass is just okay...its an okay buy but no so happy with it..i went by the reviews on the YouTube...
Best Sound quality and bass and noise cancellation excellent.ഞാൻ പ്രതീക്ഷിച്ചതുപോലെ ചെവിക്ക് വളരെ സുഗമവും വേദനയില്ലാത്തതും മികച്ച ശബ്ദ നിലവാരവും🇮🇳👍
"It's worst product, not reliable as it'll always struct somewhere. Quality is also not worth. Made me to replace it twice and more over it's volume or pause/resume buttoms wont work."
"This is a good product in this price range. Fits well in the ear and doesn't hurt if you use it for long hours. Sound quality if good and it even has bass which is not available at earphones in this price range. If you are looking for a  good product within budget, this is a good buy.  My son uses it for his online classes and he is extremely happy and satisfied."
"Wire quality is excellent, earplugs quality ok .Talkihn about the audio . Evey music 🎶 u listin seam to have extra bass boost . Original music lover may not like to listen bass all the time . So depends on the buyer perspective."
"Look no further if you have a budget of around 500 rupees. You'll not be disappointed.If you want more bass but can compromise a little bit on clarity then go for Boat 172.This has more sound clarity, enough bass, decent treble & good noise cancellation."
"No bass at all, when u listen high volume above 50% to get more bass then you ear starts paining. This is not original. Seems to be china product. Still waiting for refund. No proper response."
"These headset is filled with everything you needIt is light weight, the quality of sound is great, the bass is superb and the wire quality is also good as it has a plastic coating over it.At this price range this is the best in all comparable aspects."
Excellent bass heads.Simply awesome.I started using it and it's one of the best headset in my lifetime.Full durability with rubberized coating over wire.Build quality is also awesome but i suggest boAt for trying other varieties of colors too.Sound is good.Excellent bass and treble.Good packing and a notable tiny pouch.It's the best earphone in this price range with multi functioning button.Go for it😇
"Earphones are great, Sound is clear and crisp and Bass you get for this price is the best. Microphone is not very reliable, voice it catches is feeble and within a month, the microphone started showing some errors. It wont catch any voice, even though there is no sign of any damage.Good part is, product is under 1 year Brand Warranty and I am looking forward to get a replacement for the same."
The buttons don't work and the whole earphone stopped working within 6months. I claimed for warranty 15 days back and they haven't responded since 10 days. Absolutely horrible post purchase experience
"Purchased second time within a year, both the Headphones not working either left or right side. Unable to get warranty from Amazon. Please help me in getting product repair or replace since it's under 1 year warranty."
"Boat 242 sound and built quality is ok 3* rating, if you want purchase wired earphone then buy boat 220 the best earphone i was using."
"Boat headphones are leading the industry with High standards of Quality Assurance. This product is excellent in quality, but priced bit high as compared to other branded ones.. U can choose between money or quality.."
There is 2nd times that I've bought it as I've lost my 1st one.I have wonderful experience with this earphoneWith 8D songs It's so lovingThe most important thing that I like in this earphone is it's double layered protection wire. It is so interestingRating out of 10Bass quality-9/10Noise cancellation-10/10(with high volume)Sound quality-9/10
Boat product quality is hyped. This earphone’s mic is not good at all fir calls etc. the other party keeps hearing pounding noise. So had to buy JBL C200 si
I have got wrong product but Amazon has returned and then refunded for the boat 242 bass headphones.Anyway I had used this item before as my frndz and me have one more collection for the same.....the sound quality is osm and bass is good......only the wire connecting to the speaker 🔊 part is suffosticated and delicate so you cannot use this headphone while lying on bed specially sideways.....
"After 1 months, mic does not work properly. After the malfunction of mic within a 2 days right side stoped working.waste of money. I made a complaint in boat warranty and they took the product as the return and replacement got over in amazon.In choice of buy boat bassheads 242,go with jbl or someother brands"
I have been using Boat headphones for 3 years now. It's my second one. Amazing as always with its noise-canceling ability along with superior Bass. Works well with my Redmi Note 4 and my Lenovo laptop.
"Good but not as good as other boat headphonesAs I have used many of them asBoat rockerzz 200,etc etc...Bluetooth 239,255#Ear pain#sound bass not appropriate in relation with other boat productsBut Boat rocks bro...I'm in love with boat"
"At first I started to not like it for its bright color but suddenly my mind changed and it forced me to keep it to me with its performance. Very good bass and sound quality, the bass is a bit better than 225, and the quality of sound is equal to 225. I liked it it's very satisfying and lightweight which ensures your comfortability. If it hurts your ears don't forget to remove the hooks and make yourself comfortable."
The mic is faulty! I bought boat ignoring my friends advice that the mic will fail soon. There is lot of disturbance if the jack is turned or rotated. Tried on a lot of devices same issue. During call there is echoes. I had to open the earphone to talk. Very bad experience!!
"It's not very loud but it does offer pretty good sound for the price range. Though, even at this price range, the noise cancellation should have been somewhat better and sound should have been a little louder. It is still pretty satisfying."
I have got two of them. I am writing this two months later.In both of them the plastic part has broken and microphone has stopped working.The buttons of earphones are activating themselved.Both earphones are not in working condition now.Waste of money.Dont buy this one....My suggestion is buy realme buds 2 or buds 2 neo instead....
After 6 months of using i am editing my review one of my buds stopped working exactly after 6 months try to claim warranty otherwise  it is Very good product for this price bass is good sound goes very high hook fits in ear and won't easily get even if ur running but ear starts paining after some time of use but build quality is satisfiable my plug cover got out in only 2 days though not a problem we can stick it again all round u can buy it very nice 👌 i got it for 449 rs.thanx amazon and boat obviously 😉😉
"After using for 1.5 year I'm writing this review... mic does not catches sound from normal distance, I have to put it in front of my mouth then the person on other side could hear faint sound. Wire started to tear in several places. If you have once used a boat product try other brands also,  otherwise you cannot compare it with similar item."
- I had soaked the headphone in water for 15mins by mistake but still works great - The overall build quality of the headphone is Good - Wires are of good quality and never tangle - Best for rough use
"Awesome hands free...Writing the review after using it.. Using it from last 5 days.  Sound quality awesome, bass awesome, mic awesome.. Quality is very good.. I liked the little pouch to which was inside the pack to keep the earphones safe... Water proof definitely.. as I accidentally washed them and after the wash It is working without any issue.. so loved it.. worth the money..."
it does a great job at this price point... only thing matters is how long it lasts. I got realme earbuds 2 and this sounds better than that in sound quality... realme 2 had issue of treble and screeching...
I had Mi basic earphones earlier since last 2 years. They had better sound quality.In this earphone the sound is like metallic.Will update the review after using for sometime
Sound quality 4/5 (Bass is ok)Fits in ear very wellLength of the cable is goodGood build quality
My requirements were clear:  wanted an earphone that has the 'mic' functionality; reproduces sound fairly well and  sits comfortably in your ears.  I got all that I was looking for at a great price.
The product was very good full of bass i recommend it to bass lovers but those who like normal music i will tell them to go to other options as after using this earphone i will prefer to buy earphone which is not bass boosted and also the quality of the earphone is very good good rubber and plastic is used very nice product.
"this product is received by me on 14th Feb 2020 ... after using for 3 to 4 days I was facing issue while talking,the issue was regarding mic .. another end was not able to hear my voice.other than that wired thickness is very thin so for rough users avoid purchasing this ..Advantage:sound quality and bud comforts are much better and comfortablebass is also good"
Not as expected. Sound quality is good but not feeling surrounding sound much more only bass is over boosted. Feeling headache after 1 hour listening of songs. You can use its volume to 50% for its good sound effect. I suggest to don't buy it. You can go for remax 512 for best sound effect. And bought it in INR 649 after a it's available for INR 499 why????
Its been a month I have been using the earphones. They are perfect for the price with good sound quality and noise cancellation and perfect bass to balance the overall output. Apart from that there is the brand value and trust of Boat earphones. No issues faced as of now.
Only problem is the rubber wire some what sticky and get tangled again and again. The one coming with knitted thread covered wire are better.
"After 10 month , I'm here because , this is an impressive product that I've never ever seen in that lower price. I used it roughly and shows not any minor damage on it even my wire always tangle in between although it works and not compromise with music. It gives a convenient music but one problem is that bass not so good for bass lover. I firmly said that this is a overpowered product."
"Good earphone within this price range. But one bud stopped working within 1 moth after purchasing the product, but company replaced that product within 1 week and that process was very smooth as compared to other brands. Actually it should not happen, but boat did a very good job in replacement"
Le Lo Mast HaiPyar Sirf Ek SeBaaki Sab Lust HaiBass Bhayankar Best HaiOther Earphones Peace in Rest HaiSasta Hai Achha HaiLe Lo isko Mast Hai
"I have bought this product in 28/09/2020 and today is date 25 march 2020 the built quality is not good the corners of the earbuds are torned apart, I haven't used this product roughly after taking so much care still it's torned. I can't replace it because because it's doesn't cover in the warranty. Don't buy it if u wish to use for longer time it's material is not good it tears"
"The most important part i love about this earphone is that it is durable, i am using it scince February and it is working nice till now, and sound cancellation was good for few months after i bought but now its not that much good but still i will recommend people to use this earphones if you are a traveller, an athlete, or sometimes you plug in and sleep it won't get damaged and it's really good."
Plz Don't buy it . One side of headphone Don't work after a week .they are not interested in return item..they are making fool by give cheap item . I think it is a local product. Plz don't but it
"Wonderful looks..But quite painful to ears coz of the design.. But changing the buds will help.Sound is good, but noise cancelling could be better..All together u can have a budget friendly, good looking earphones..No loss in trying!!"
Second time ordered. This headfones are one of the best in class you can get in this price range.Sound quality reminds me of w550i Sony Ericsson phone. boat has done awesome job in delivering sound.Perfect balance of bass and treble. Seller has original product and Amazon guy's are super fast in delivering the product
Amazing product....boat is now making a quality product in such a cheap price....in 500 u get clear sound proper bass best wire and a cute pouch.. i have buyied 2 ....iska price 1000 bhi jota me tab bhi kharidta...lets see how much month it works...me night me sote hue bhi use krta hun...full ridged use
i love it's deep bass 😍😍💖but vocal n mid tones need to improve.it's only for bass lovers... not for true music lovers or music composer because u can't hear anything except bass.
"After using for 3 months:For Call: Voice from other end is very muddy, not able to get the clear sound. Mic is average. Not good for calling purpose.For Music: Bass is very high, doesn't seem natural."
"Expectations not reached, after few days of using this product I am giving review now it's not working properly,when i am connected with my mobile some issues is coming by default cal disconnected with out my involvement songs also connected, Amazon is giving best service but the seller of this product is not good I am not satisfied with this product. Better to go for another product."
"Noise cancellation happens, but worst with additional notice from Headphones.Buttons and Controls do not work at all. Neither the Microphone and its controls nor the Volume buttons work.Highly suspicious on the used product which may have been returned by someone. Highly disappointing service."
I had ordered the same earphone but with different color so I thought of some new color but this didn't even work for 10 days.
Better to purchase Boat 225 than this product . . . I have Boat 225 and no comparison with this product Boat225 is amazing .  Not suggesting anyone to purchase this Boat 242 to anyone.
First I bought one after few months one side of the earphone stopped working thought it was my fault so order another one after sometime same happened.Thought sound and bass was good but manufacturing quality was not good it's based on my experience.
"Bass is super ,but up to 75% volume more than that it's so much to hear .And using continuous more than 1 hrs ,it causes pain in ear bone,other than that its marvelous."
AWRSOME EARPHONES @AWESOME PRICE!!! AMAZON DEALS ARE UNBEATABLE.... GOT IT FOR 400.....BEST EARPHONES UNDER 1000RS....BASS 5/5NOICE CANCELLATION 5/5SIUND QUALITY 5/5100%VALUE FOR MONEY.....
"Its a great deal for 499 Rs., as always boat gives you good products. Mostly incomparable price and quality is what they seek. The 242 series is like a bundle of joy within a economic range. The sound is good the balance between bass and treble along with mids and highs are great. Instead of saying noice cancellation I would like to call it a nice noise isolating earphone. ""Plug in to feel the beats..."""
"The only thing that I personally like about this product is the quality it provides..but when I come to built quality it should be somewhat strong enough to be used for longer period of time....""Realme buds 2"" is really far better option.. *not a brand pramotion it's an honest review"
The sound quality of the speakers and the mike are excellent. The product finish and packing are exquisite.
After using for nearly ten days my wife who takes online classes for her school kids and almost uses it for7 hours everyday and now she feels earpieces hurting and injuring her ear skin.But the return window for this item ended on 31Jan2021.If allowed will exchange for a better designed item of boAt earphone/headphone.Thanks
Until the right ear stopped working things were good and it stopped working only after 30 days!!! Not sure whether it is a genuine BOAT product.
"It has a sort of coating along with a clip that's supposed to keep tangles to a minimum but it's hard to say how much difference it will make in the long run. Would have preferred it if it were braided instead, but other than that it's prrtty decent in other areas"
"Good stylist earphone, but those wires are feel so cheap, not the best but sound is clear. Coming with extra 2 pair grip. Multifunction switch are working good. Yes happy with is product ... Hope for long lasting😊"
Boat is good. Always maintaining it's quality. But one suggestion if it's implementation noise cancellation in budget  headsets like this it will touch the sky
"Nice product*Bass 6/5*Sound 5/5*Design 6/5*Bulid 4/5 (Plastic build)*Comfort 3/5(with earhooks)*****Nice product at this range as compared to realme buds 2 as I have tested both ,and feel that sound,bass and design is good in basshead242 but comfort and build quality is good in realme buds 2....it's my opinion"
"Sound, noise cancelling, bass all features are quite good then it's own 225 model.I recieved the package open at the time of delivery. The design of volume buttons and Jack differs from what it is shown in the product image, I doubt if I have received the original headphones.Amazon should look in the issue of open packages during delivery."
Noise is very painful in ear..When I was purchased before that I saw review after that I thought its good quality earphone but in reality the product quality is very bad..... Please replace this product and improve sound quality in future..So I don't recommend to anyone..Buy bluetooth boat earphone...
Ok great sound.Good clairty of listening music but bass not to the mark. Realme buds 2 are better than these product in my opinion
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
 Within one year of warranty left side speaker is low sound
"Passive noise cancellation is good in this earphone.But sound quality is not that good. In the time of drinking water few drop fall on the mic, the mic is not working properly after that."
A useless product by BOAt. Never buy this. A month of rare usage and we find that the cable snapped leaving one earphone go silent. See the pics. Voice clarity is below par and require to hold the mouth piece close to the lips for audible sound on the other side.Total waste of money.

" This earphone is the ultimate destination for music lovers in cheap rate.It comes with 2 extra earbuds and 1year warranty card.It delivers all the qualities as promised,once you attach the ear phone it will never slips out no matter how strenuous work you are doing.I am so satisfied with this product and pricing."
"I don't like this product and the main reason behind this, cz product quality & sound quality of this product is not like actual brand boat quality, It is like worst product sound is not clear and the body of this product is not good and the conclusion is WASTE OF MONEY, If you want to waste your money then you can purchase."
Best one to purchase for video/audio calls. Crystal clear voice and microphone. Best in class within INR... You also get a cute and nice pouch (though it is small) to keep the earphones.
Earphone stop working with in 3 months and they have worst customer support center in the world. When i complaint and request for a replacement they shipped me empty box. Now they are not responding my call. felling angry and thugged
very bad product in first 7-8day working fine but after 8days sounde is not good.. when music play some other sounf play even when music is off some noise come.. very dispoint i am going to buy real me buds 2 but beacuse of youtube suggest video i slecr this and i weste my money yes extra noise come from earphone very distrube noise
"No doubt it's a pretty decent and a good quality earphones under a budget but after using  for a couple of months the quality degraded,declined/muted calls automatically,paused songs, Google assistance open up anytime,had no control over the earphones all together.Disappointed but happy that it lasted for 6+months."
Its very much good for a loud and clear sound with a virtual feel of bass as it  produces a bass evasive sound... Rest assured if u can handle a  light build water resistant with not hoarse sound earphone go for this one... Best in sound but the cables are little thin so be careful...
Agr itna paisa v dekr aaplogo ka kaan me problem ho toh kya fadya..or kya difference rh jayega 50-60rs earphones or aapke branded earphone me..bhaiyo ye mera bilkul genuine review h Mai isse use kr rha hu or pubg khelta hu plus song or movies v dekhta hu..ears me itna pain hota h na ki kya bole ..pls don't buy kisi or brand ka dekh lo aaplog isko mat lena 😡😡😡

" Well brilliant bass and clear sound as expected from boat!!!! And fit in ear perfectly due to the extra plastic stylish edge,worthy full product."
Product is really good. It came in good condition with extra ear pads. Sound quality is good. There is no distortion or interference. This gets into ear well and doesn't give any discomfort.
Omgoodness.  I am so impressed with the sound quality. Complete noise cancellation.  I workout wY the gym with these and no obstruction of the music being played. I am happy with this product. Now I wNt to see the durabiltiy will post an update on the same soon
"Back of ear will be painful after 15 minutes usage, my ear are not small but the size of earphone are little uncomfortable the hooks are little too rough for ears"
"I am using it since more than a year, it is still working without any issues.The red Boat symbol of both earbuds lost on few weeks."
"I have been using all boat products, this one has disappointed with its quality which is not worth the money I paid."
"Very nice.. ear phone. Good quality of sound, base tribal,mic.I tried many ear phone but my all not fit in my ear this is good bcoz it has ear holder by which it fit and stuck in my ear and not drop from ear."
"BASS HEADSThe name tells it all, it snugly fits, no pain at all. Moreover good noise cancellation .Call quality is excellent. Good wire qualityCons : i think they have boosted bass vocals are clear but mids should have been boosted little bit anyways at this price we can't comment more . In short, a great quality product..Go 4 it without a second thought"
"First impression was the quality of the pieceSecond was the bassThird was the noise cancellationTested devices iphone x,oppo a5,iphone 11,iphone 11 pro max,mi a3, samsung s10+,honor 8xThe bass quality was amazingThis is very better than biat bassheads 225I use bose sound sport wired as primaryThis is getting near to near experience and i cant explain how it feels in bose"
"Anyone willing to buy this product shall must not buy this as product is pathetic chinese product . Very thin wires and from Day 1 you will get distrubance in voice whenever you touch 3.5 mm jack chord, earbuds are too big to adjust and it would cause pain and high discomfort when you use this"
"I love this earphone likee to the next level the bass is good af.. And the ear fit is perfect it won't fall out until you remove it from your ears and idk why people arw that much complaining about it giving pain after some hours.. It is a perfect fit and it doesn't give that much pain in the ears.. I didn't even realise it's in my ear.. Its that comfortable, and the build quality is top notch.. Worth the price.. If you're taking this one go for it."

" This is a good earphone but I suggest you to take good care of this ,like plucking from  phones and using the earphone in multiple devices will surely damage it . overall sound quality and all is best but notice cancellation is not good as Realme Buds .."
Boat is doing really good in terms of manufacturing earphones. The sound quality and base will definitely impress you if you are into listening loud music. Overall I’m very happy with these earphones and they are quiet durable as well.If you want to buy earphones with an affordable price. This is your best shot. Go for it
"Sometimes hissing sound comes up while on phone call using these earphones. When on webex calls, and if there is any incoming call which u disconnect then, webex call volume is reduced and i have to replug it to get back the original volume level"
The earphones one side stoped working within a month might be a default piece for me but yah it got spoilt within a month but it has a 1year warranty so I am safe I hope they come and collect the earphones and give me a New ProductOverall the product is superb nice sound quality nice packing comes with a pouch to keep earphones..
Everything is good as mentioned & using from last 10days & working fineOnly durability is little but less rest is all good
Boat basshead 450 has very clear sound and bass is also good.Many comparison videos on youtube says that boat 225 has better bass than 242 it is true because i also had 225. But the difference is not so big you will barely feel the difference in bass. If you did not compare both earphone together you will not find any difference.Overall 242 has nice sound quality and bass. You can buy it.
"I bought two headphones, in both of them mic stopped working in few days.Pathetic quality.Are you making it in China.No buy for me."
For most of the users it's absolutely suitable ...build quality is osm... sound quality is great for me... noise cancellation is moderate...And the boat is the brand in itself...:)Thanks Boat ❤️
Sound Quality SUCKS! I've used 3 headset of BOAT but this one's sound quality is worst among them! I've used Boult Loop headset who's base and vocals are far better than this one which was available at lower price than this one at Flipkart! I bought it at ₹450!
"Sound quality is good but much on bass side. Everything was working good till suddenly left earpiece died out of the blue, and that too before even completing 1 month!!!Got the replacement after a month of wait, and that too is dead now !!"
"You will love this earphone. Sound quality is good and you can listen to each beat easily and at this price no brand will give u performance like this ,wire is of good quality and easy to untangle. Using it for few month. Mic quality is good too and there is a clipper in it to clip earphone to your shirt/t-shirt that's a good one and very useful l."
"So I bought this product because i need a cheap earphone giving a good experience on my PS4. I was really satisfied with these earphones, Bass is next level, sound quality is absolutely OK’ish/really good, as the earphones are completely covering your ear, there is a fair amount of noise cancellation. Best experience is listening to music. For me, for this price these earphones are good for gaming and music and other internet surfing."
Product is awesome .....But delivery service in this area is pathetic .This is not for this product only....every amazon delevry service in this area is very much downgraded...Its requeat from amazon to change their delivery partner in this area
"For the price point, it's the best. Bass is thumping, sound might be a bit more clearer in realme buds 2, but again, this is cheaper. And also 1 yr warranty, realme comes with 6 months. All in all, good product."
"Very good sound, good aesthetic. But giving problem after a month. Volume suddenly becomes maximum again and again damaging your ears. Tried on other phone, still the problem. We have asked for replacement"
"Product is very Nice audio quality is Best By boat ❤️❤️  GOOD PRODUCT AT LOW PRICE OVERALL VALUE FOR MONEY .BUT THERE IS ONE PROBLEM WITH THE PRODUCT NOT SO STRONG  CABLES WHICH CAN GET BROKE ANYTIME, THATS THE ONLY THING THAT I DON'T LIKE IN THIS EARPHONE 🥲😑"
Right earpiece is not working properly. Received a defective product. Really disappointed! I haven't expected this from a big brand like boat.This is the second time i bought this earphone. First one worked for about 5-6 months. But this one not even a day. I have submitted its replacement.
"This earphone worked perfectly, and for the price it is one of the bests in the market. I contacted bOAt in the middle for some repair issues and they were veru courteous and helpful too. I have been exclusively using their products for the past two years"
"Pathetic headset, right side ear piece stopped working within a month."
Overall sound and product quality is good. But the I find it little bit uncomfortable wear the earphones for long.Since we are working from home. I end up wearing it for couple of hours in a go. And then it starts to hear.
"Nice Brand. Sound Quality amazing. After 6 months of usage, one ear side not working... Applied Warrenty. They replaced with the new piece. Love it.. Their warranty policy is great...."
This is the best priced item which i have bought in Amazon...its actually good to go without any hesitation
I have been using this for almost 2 monthsBass is goodCall quality is excellentIt's good for both music and moviesAlthough if you wear it for a long time ur ears starts to feel a little uncomfortableOther than thatIt's a amazing earphone go for it
"The clip is of different colour , Sound quality is good noise cancellation is not available at all, bass is ok but in comparison of other earphones it's not upto the Mark at this price of 499. And it's hard to insert 3.5 jack it's slips.and glitch more."
i bought 3rd boat product and m very much satisfied with boat product and this earphone i have say that must buy in this price range its very good
I bought second time same product I'm really happy with his sound bass and noise cancellation best killer budget earphones ever !!! Don't go for reviews if u have ₹500 and in sale u may get ₹350 go for it and it's wide color variety awesome product
Amazon delivery is very fast and neat....but the Sound quality is very cheap...it is not producing a sound quality to the price...very disappointed...there no option of return
"I am big fan of this company since I bought my first boAt bass head. It has no problem at all Bass is good can be more affective(but according to price it is good), Noise Cancellation is perfect, Sound can be better if your phone has inbuilt Dolby then there is not any problem. But sound needs to be improve. But still its not that expensive if u want perfected earphone try JBL."
"Very gud product, i have purchased 2 for my husband and my father. They have a wrong ear problem where other earphones even costly ones slip out every now and then. But this one stays and they are finally happy with an earphone which i have got them!!! Very gud one and highly recommeded.Sound quality is also amazing."
It is too loud you can not use it above 30-35% valume and totally uncomfortable in ear it's like 100 rs earphone by its actual quality. I do not recommend to buy this product even in offer you can find better then this total west of money I am feeling regret feeling cheated after buying this.
"Wires are so thin and after some time ears slightly starts paining while listening in this earphone these only the problem with this but all other things like sound quality, bass etc. are superb."
It's not even a month and it's has stop functioning properly. The sound is almost gone. And it creates a buzzing noise when plugged in.My experience with Boat headphonest keep getting bad
"Arrived packing intact, requested colour, and on time. Tried them with LG & Mi smartphones and they work as advertised. Good treble and bass and adequate dB levels. Noise cancellation does not apply and I do not expect it at this price point."
"It's high on bass and quite loud. However, it doesn't ruin the soul of a melody either. Go for it if tiye budget is under 500"
"Pros:1 ear support for sports activities2 volume controls3 multipurpose button4 earphone carry case5 clipCons1 less bassRest everything is fine, decent earphones for work from home. Most unexpected feature was of volume control."
Its good i have used it early and when brother bought so i thought i would also buy this amazing product and enjoy it and its noise cancellation have to improve some more and the bass is high and sound quality is also good..........i love this product and its a monster for pubg i recomment this you to buy if you are looking for a speaker.....bye
Bought this for the second time. Bought a pair for another person as well. Best earphones among the ones I've used till date. Earplugs are there so that it doesn't fall while walking. The sound quality is amazing!
It’s surprisingly good sounding earphone for 400 odd rupees. Clear sound. Good bass. Wire is sturdy and doesn’t feel like it’ll snap if mishandled. Doesn’t hurt your ear even with long hours of use. The buds are soft and bendable so fits very comfortably.Overall very good.
Good sound quality compared to price. I bought it at rs350 on offer. At this price this is a good choice.
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
 Anything like a normal headphoneIt's designed very coolIn this price range it is awesome 👌And also good for gamingNo problem
"Worest product...i purchased this product on 22nd jan..2021...one month it works good...after that the music is suddenly down,volume goes to zero,ear grips are loose...google asst is open,audio songs is jump automatically to another...much irritating...i disappinted at this product..."
"I purchased this product in Feb 2021. Today, in August the product wires have actually got split within 7 months of purchase. If this is supposed to last only 6-7 months then why buy an expensive earphone !! Shoddy product quality! Better to stay away from this.."
Sound quality and the bass quality is pretty good in this price range.But i didn't get the good item in first deliveryI've to replace it with the new one.Hope Boat will improve their services towards the products and make them better than beforeSo that customers can get the best item in their first delivery.
"Product is worth penny, bass is good, fits perfectly and do not hurt your ears even if you use it for hours,packaging:- packaging was brilliant and also you'll be given extra buds, good quality pouch to keep the earphonesalso it comes with 1 year manufacturing warrantyand you'll get a cable clip manager for adjusting the earphones for your comfort.overall I'll say its awesome.Thank you Boat."
"First of all....Boat earphones are no doubt excellent. I'm using it since 8 months. If you are buying any of boat earphones, just relax and go for it, you will not have any complaints with the boat company (if you are using it properly).But I have a complain about the Amazon company.. packaging is not worthy. I expected it much better. Hope the company will overcome this.Thank you."
"Put in extra couple hundred bucks and go for realme buds 2 or buds neo. Pathetic sound quality. You can't enjoy all genres of music in this,maybe the baasy music a bit but that's it, lyrics fade from music, it's not soft, it's just loud that's itNo serious music lover shall go for this."
"Almost like Senheiser within good rate. It's sound is better when you listen to music even when you minimize it's volume, except for it's bass. It's sound quality is also good on audio calls on any app. It also does look stylish with the type of earbuds it has got which fits well on ears."
It is the best earphone for price I have tried many earphone best it is the best so far it is good for gaming listening music and it's mic quality is also good. But it's your choice after all u can buy either this or realme buds 2 U will not regret  so at last it's your choice.
"Worst earphones ever.My left earbud was not working at all so we applied for return and inreturn they gave us , another non working earfones.Buttons dont work properly and our mobile start opening another apps like google and even start calling randomly.Do not buy this earphones ever.They're fraudsters!"
"A really great buy under 500 bucks. These are really comfortable in my ears. it gives loud and sharp voice. Bass quality is pretty good, build quality looks great. I'm writing this review on the base of the first look that I have on the product."
"Its overall a good quality earphone, more bass than treble. If your criteria is bass then go for the 220, I felt I downgraded myself switching from 220 to 240.The 220 has metal buds which feel premium while this is plastic and feels cheap, also the 220 has a right angled headphone jack which makes it sturdy and good for long time use, the 242 doesn't"
Has a crispy soud quality. Good for melodious romantic songs. Adequate bass. But the quality of the bass could be improved. Good built quality but wire would have been better. Such wire may be tangle free but does not lasts long. Most import thing is the position of in line mic and volume control wich is not available in most of the products at even higher prices.
I have used Boat 100 bassheads and even Boat  450 headphones. I absolutely loved the Boat sound but these headphones were a disappointment that I had to return them. There was very minimal bass and sound clarity was like the earphones u get inside a flight. I had to get these cause the boat 450 broke blame it on plastic build quality and the Boat 100 stopped working. But I would pick the Boat 100 anytime if you want a good budget earphone.
"After sharp 6 months, left earbud's volume is disappeared. It's gone. Waste of money ₹550.  Even my ₹400 worth samsung earphone works well for 2years. And Karbonn Titanium Machfive Mobile's in-box headphone lasts for 3 years. Totally disappointed by boAt. IT SINKS IMMEDIATELY AFTER STARTING THE VOYAGE."
"First of all I am one of the big fan of BOAT, they have a quality with variant of colors.. love the green and got the 💚 green..In terms of sound it's always awesomeIn terms of quality it's amazing.Go with BOAT, no need to think twice."
"I was looking for budget earphones that I could use during my runs.Bam!! These earphones are loud, provide you ample noise isolation, don't fall off even during your hard running sessions!! And have decent audio quality with very very good bass.I would highly recommend these earohones if you're looking for something that doesn't fall off during runs and workout sessions."
Mind blowing purchase. Best product in the market with affordable price. boAT company keep it up. Sound quality superb
with in 2 days microphone stopped working and dedicated keys also not working for my mobile...I used Boat Bluetooth for longtime but this product is very disappointed one
"Actual great upgrade from boat bassheads 225...and cable quality is simple awesome,Boat always prefer user recommendation and provide the robust and quality product."
"Poor bass quality.Ghost commands by wiring issues.Not satisfied with it.Nearly after 6 months, its left side has stopped working.This product is crap!!!"
Sound quality superbUsing this since 4 months and no problem reported till now..Not a single side is stopped..Both earplugs are working perfectly.. if u are wondering to buy or not..Buy it for sure.. grab this deal ..!  they are not noise cancellation..bt for regular and casual wear..it is superb and budget friendly..Go for it!!
A buzzing sound while callingSound quality for songs is goodI replaced that and got a new one which is really good
Might be good for phone calls but music is average. Boss average.You can listen good music in low volume.Not suggested for music lovers.
I have been using jbl 200 earphones from my school days. But this earphones are the best. U cant get that jbl base but the sound quapity is so real. if u plug it in u feel like u r hearing with a surround system. U will not feel u r wearing  earphones. so comfortable. Sound will blow ur head. Half the volume is enough al the time. thats how high the sound is. Plz go for it. THE BEST.
All is good except it's transparent rubber hook which keeps falling off from its position. It's uncomfortable when every time to put it back to its place
I think it is best product at its price point ..It is provided with volume control rocker and phon pick up button....Has descent bass sound quality and durability....It has week wire bt careful handling overcome this problem....
I buy this earphone so that I can use wired earphones while working at office or when I need charge my Bluetooth earphones. And this earphone from BoAt is really a great purchase but if you are not like to use a little hard earphones then this is not for you .
"Great earphone at this price range.Pros: Wire has some coating over it which is great. Bass is good. It has volume & next buttons. Earbud is small in size which fits verywell in ears and doesn't come out like my earlier basshead 225.Cons: You can NOT hear song at full volume since it has loud sound, but it can be avoided by hearing at less volume.Overall i liked it and worth to buy."
"Quality is super noise is louder, bass quality is excellent. Also call quality is excellent. 60-70%sound is enough loud. Only drawback is it hurts after 2-2.5 hours of use and it's not tangle free cabel. I will give three Star for its design otherwise quality is excellent"
The headphones has ear connector that makes it firmly attached to the ear. This is very helpful as sometimes the bud is not enough. The sound quality is awesome.
I have received less Quality ear plugs (rubber material) and overall red is not good option instead of red colour take black color earphones in this product
"I have purchased it on December but it stopped working on May. But using 1year warranty , boat replaced the damage produect with a new same earphone by door to door delivery. I didn't spend any money for claiming my warranty. Besides sound is very nice and heavy . I am enjoying. Thanks boAt."
The product was really good and it has a warranty of one year. Within 6 months I had a problem with this product and the warranty claim contact person are not available. The number mentioned over here for warranty claim is not reachable.
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
 Earphone seems like it already used by someone as u can see in pictures its earphone connector is tilted and product packaging is very very rubish & poor.This is NOT expected from Amazon .& Second time after replacing item its not support my device realme 8 5G.
Fell for the color at once but i was paranoid about the in-ear extensions. I read a couple of reviews which said that it can be uncomfortable while lying down but they are removable and the earphones can be used as regular earphones while not working out or running.The bass is obviously very good as the name suggests. Mic is sensitive enough. Sound is crisp and clear.I think its a good choice for the price range. (Got it for 500 INR)
"Facing issues with mic even before completion of 1 month.Sound quality is amazing but what do I do with good sound quality if the build quality doesn't support.I was a boat head, but very disappointed after this product."
I purchased this product in April 2021 with one year warranty.... but its been only 8-9 months these are giving some serious problems..... m not able to take calls or not even able to listen music.... headphones will stop responding in between calls and volume will increase and decrease on its own...
I am using this headphone 🎧 for more than 3 months and I am happy of it's specs. In the beginning my ears have a pain due to the large hooks even though it is made up of soft material and after a month of usage I was used to it and I didn't have any pain. The next this is it's sound quality is very outstanding and I love to hear sounds with this and it's bass quality is also good.
"When you're in closed room than you can feel the bass, but when you're on the go driving or outside you won't get that bass as outside noise would make loud music down. For those who like loud music this is not the one you're searching for;This can be used for calling or daily use but not for music lovers."
Sound quality is excellent..Bass is also goodNoice cancellation is average.Anyway it is absolutely value for money product from boat
"Sound quality is good as always, boat has come out as one of the dependable brands.Active Noise cancellation you just can't except at this price but passive one is there. Moisture wicking is amazing."
I like this product butBut I don't like costumer servicesBecause thay didn't respond after delivered product perfectlyI purchased this befor 5 monthsNow one side automatically stoped workingAnd I'll contact customer service but thay are not give me any answer and thay don't try to contact me....
I gifted to my younger brother. He is really happy with the sound quality. It will make you feel as similar as apple AirPods (wired). Must buy.
"If u r looking for budget friendly earphone, than u r at right place... Excellent bass, literally u will shake ur head with each beat, good grip and nice colour(spirit lime)Though i have not heard other expensive earphone till.... But it is showcase....Cons:  ear pain on long tym listening...."
"Not satisfied with the product. Guys I suggest you to buy the old boat 225 they are much better. If you are a pro equalizer use then the best Boult audio bass buds are best (oak wood model) it has inbuilt sub woofers.  These are just okay, too much treble"
Sirf 3months me kharaab ho gya... Amazon sirf ghatiya product bech rha... Yha se koi saaman na khareede
"Bass is super low, it can be only heard on full volumes, and listing on full volumes can be bad since the earphones are pretty loud.In build quality on the main wire is of very good quality, but the rest of the build is quite bad.overall its fine for the price but dont justifies the name basshead."
My first boat product and my experience is awsome now i am gona buy boat wireless neckband under 2000 just comparing which one is best for me i need long battery life . I am using oneplus z bass edition more than 7 months now it not working i break the right side wire some how its my fault other wise great earbuds oneplus
After using for 3months its started to give trouble. I mean suddenly the volume control stops working. First time disappointed with BOAT
Good quality buildGood quality sound 💗Loved itThe wire should have been braided though.After a few days it's now available at 399 bucks😅😅😅😅😅May be I should have waited.
Value for money- fit for ear- pretty decent quality- boat always get you a new one under warrantyOverall it's a good ear phone for meetings and music. True value for money.
"One of the earphones. Compared to bassheads 225/220, the only pro that 225 has is L shape connector and the ear tips that you get is not that great. In other scenarios, it's comforting, slightly better sound and good fit.Wait for some day, when it is priced at 400, buy it."
"I bought this pair of earphones about three months ago and already the one of the sides has stopped working. While the buttons work, there is no sound in the right side. The sound quality is good but it is packaged in a product that breaks down in less than 6 months. Would not recommend unless you can get it heavily discounted."
Product doesn't work as expected when connect to Laptop.The other user on call hears very feable sound when I connect this earphone .I guess the microphone must get better.Where as it's not the case when I do not use the Earphone
Worst product. It was good for 4 days the 5th day one side of the headphone had a low volume other side was fine after a week both side of the headphone started having a low volume but the mic was good it was clear it was not grudge
Best earphone at this price..Wire quality is decent..Bass is great..Treble is also good key quality is very good and this is my favourite colour..
Sound quality is amazing. Noise cancellation is also good. Bass quality is rocking. Must buy. I want boAt Bassheads 242 in neon colour. I am searching every where in online sites but not available or out of stock that particular neon colour. But Amazon helps me within 4-5 days. Today I got the my favorite boAt Bassheads 242 in neon colour. Thanks a lot Amazon & Thanks boAt also.
"Good sound quality , mic is good during calls , colour is quite different , good bass , but can listen continuously for an hour not more. Go for it. Waterproof and can be used in rain also. Who gives waterproof for ₹399."
"BOAT SPORT,Sound is Awesome 👌🏻, Premium quality 👌🏻 ,BassHEADs 242,Mind-blowing 😇,look like a Finished. With Carry bagGoogle assist, Ear grip light and Color combination Good.colour like fresh.Delivered within 3rd days."
One of the best earphones at reasonable price. Good noise cancellation and nice bass. A bit issue with comfortability but acceptable. Nice while listening songs during a trip or while resting on bed.Nice grip which is very helpful during jogging.WORTH YOUR PRICE!! MUST TRY AT LEAST ONCE.
"Excellent earphones. This is the best earphone under the range of ₹500. Tops in sound quality, noise elimination and fitting. It comes with a very helpful and small carrying bag or pouch and a sticker. Moreover, just loved the product. Thanks to boAt.#Plug into nirvana"
"It's the worst headphone I have ever bought. 🤢🤮The quality of sound and noise cancellation is not as good as they claimed.😠 I bought this 2 month ago, and now while calling, it's being disconnected automatically, and I'm facing too much trouble with this product. I'm very disappointed with it. I'll not suggest u to buy it. 🤕"
I loved this product & even packaging was very good ...... price is little High....we can get this thing ...under 450.rs ..but any way product is good if you are looking for a wired earphones 🎧 little costly but worth it. Ii have used this 2 months & now I am giving review . Personally highly recommended by me ..😉
"For this price, it's way better than any other..."
"This is a review after 1 year after the warranty is over (Purchased in Sep 2020).The earphone was outstanding throughout in all the areas (Bass, Mic, Stereo); However after an year, one side of the earphone is not working anymore. As one can expect it to occur from China manufacturers."
"I used it for listening to Music, Movies and phone conversations.Music sounds plain in it, it sounds dull and pathetic,Movie experience is horrible as well.Phone conversations are worse. The person on the other side is hearing 'static' / 'buzz' voice since I received this feeble piece of technology."
Don't buy boat products!!!! It is my warning to u cause I bought 2 headphone from boat and both are dead in a month boat rockerz 510 and this one so buy another product from another company it will be Ur good choice
"Been only using for 5 months, still good!!Edit:After a year of use, it's not good anymore, but surprisingly I can hear in both sides. I don't think it will last longer than a year."
It was great one I bought but now after 2 months of usage I am getting some problems on the right side of the headset. And am sure that it will not last longer than 1 month more. Was using a jbl headphone for last 1 year I have gave that one to cousin and bought this one but it totally diapponts
i have purchased this product 2 month back. from last week one side of headset is not working. This is the first time i am seeing boat product got failed in 2 month. please do the needful
"Loved using this headset. It has better audio quality and its previous version. Loved using it, good bass and clear audio."
"I have ordered it in December last, 2019. It's Oct 2020. The color faded. The sounds quality faded... And now, it stopped working. First 4 months were superb. Then the peformance degraded. Don't BUY"
"Sound Quality equal to boat 152 Bassheads... Volume switch and Ear hook,swet resistance is the good features. sometimes ear have pain by the ear hook ,not too much a little bit.mic to jack cable is okk durable,but drivers to mic is small wires and I don't know is it durable"
"Mic doesn't working properly sound quality is too poor and cheap don't buyCheapest product ever received from brand BOAT. Under warranty mic not working, call quality is too poor and main thing.... No customer service available . Customer executive never reply your phone calls."
"The ear phone broken cable detached to speaker and speaker is visible out side, I tried keep the speaker inside and close the caps back , but after 2 more days second ear phones also faced same issue, cannt use more than a week, waste product."
I just received the warranty claimed replaced item bcz after 7 months of usage one of the side stop working. The replaced item is even better than before. Liked the service from boat. Definitely recommend to everyone
"The best at this price. Extremely good sound and bass, clear and even great noise cancellation. I couldn't have asked for more at this price. Stylish, great looking and great color variety. I chose this lemon yellow as this suits my personality."
I am using this last 2 months and really Better than boat225 I am also used boat225 that is also good but its not comfortable and its not provide the immersive sound. The boat242 provide 3d sound and bass I like the sound Soo much and I am refer u to take this one its really butiful experience with boat ⛵ for me #iloveboat
Great bass. Fitting is very good. No pain in the.ear.Clarity is good . Can be slightly better for the price. Own both wired and wireless Boats earphones and both are very good quality.
Very good quality. Easy to handle. wire is also in good quality. I am regularly used. I am kept it in  separate purse. Worth of the product. Sound is also very good when compare to local product.
"Only recommended for bass lover, best earphone in this price range ,but neon colour is not looking amazing best quality and sound quality was amazing sharpness is little bit high and base is ultrahigh, first-time satisfied with an earphone, the mic quality was also amazing and all the buttons are are  nice 🙂well done boat"
"Very Very Bad Products And BrandLow Bass ,Sound Quality Is Very BadUse 20min and you feel the pain😍I'm Order 2nd time and both r Very Bad!!!Kindly Improve Your Products!Thank you 😑"
Just Amazing...Really worth buying and the clip that comes with the earphones is very useful..dont loose it.😂Bass-Super clear...Met my expectations.Sound clarity- I observed difference in all songs when listening with these earphones and my regular earphones.These are bass boosted earphones when compared to normal one.
Everything was perfect 👌👌👌BassSound qualityCableDesignProduct qualityAll were awesomeI am very much satisfiedThank you boatAmazon delivery was fastThank youLittle improvement in packaging by Amazon  should be done
"Product material is good and sound quality is crisp. It's got a equaliser button, but haven't used it. So far I have used these earphones only for my conference calls."
It is must buy earphone with punchy basssss....The wire is of awesome quality.....It will give you premium look as well as premium feel because of clear and punchy bass ...It will not disappoint you iam sure...If you remove the noice cancellation rubber it will fit properly on my ear ....
Mass bass qualityClear sound outputIf u want sound quality instead of this headphone u should buy two loud speakers and tied with ur ear because I changed 3 headphone within 3 month because of bass and sound clarity but now I fully satisfied with this headset .Very nice product .More than value for money
i have enjoyed amazing experiences by the best bass sound quality and amazing outter noise cancellation but it's built quality is very poor build in very cheap plastic metirial it's not worth for money for this built quality but it 100 worth for its performance in audio the tangled wire is so good
I really liked the earphones it has really nice bass and sound quality noise cancelling is also good but it has a issue that the red par of the hardware gets damaged easily so it ruins the look but if you don't care about the look then it's best for you as the sound and bass is really good
"It is an awesome product. If you are thinking to buy it go for it undoubtedly it will never disappoint you. The music quality,bass quality is awesome it is highly durable product with one year guarantee too .And with boat brand . I am fully satisfied with it and also recommend to buy it."
Sound quality and bass are great for the price. Major problem I faced while using the product was it's durability around the Audio jack it is not durable enough. It was loosen after three weeks of usage and audio was not clear. But it was replaced easily from the boAt's service center.
Bass is really good and the build quality of wire really good and volume controls and noise cancellation made this product even better 100% recommend. The only con i faced is the clip. The wire is slipping from the clip which you wont face after a week. so far so good after almost 6 months use no problem at all
"Don't get fooled by the reviews. The build quality is worse, the earphones are glued. The base is boosted a lot by default, which is completely distorted ( not balanced). The bass suppresses the treble and the earphone kinda vibrates which is very annoying. Most of the reviewers are new buyers or they barely seem to know anything about music."
Mic is not working and also right side is not working. I have warranty but what I am going to do with it as Boat's service centres are no where near my house. They don't even have pick up and drop service. Now I am stuck with this earphones. Total waste of money.
Best earphones I have got under 500 INR. I was worried when I saw negative comments on this earphone but i risked and bought one on jan 2020 until now it's been like 5 months and it's working perfectly like when it was new. Bass is good and respectable sound quality for this price range. If ur looking for best earphones below 500 I'll recommend it to u 200 percent. Hope this helps.
"Great build quality in this price range also have to sound .The only problem for me is the mic, while during call the receiver side will only get a feeble sound .if mic is quality is no issue .Then it is the best product from my experience as i have used other earphones in this price range which usually won't work within 2 months"
Built and material quality is very good.You can feel the bass at high level of sound.All sound can be heard clearly.
It's descent for the price paid. Build quality can be improved. Grip in ears is good. Blue color looks stylish. Mic quality is good as I see no complaints from other side.
"Beautiful colour. Mine is blue. Actually tangle free. Very light weight.  Comes with different size ear buds which helped me a lot. Good sound quality.  Easy volume button. With a clip that, again, helped me."
It did not supported my Nokia 7.1. There was disturbance everytime I plugged in and out. The sound quality on iphone was good but was poor on nokia. The vol button has started malfunctioning. Good for only 6 months.
1 side stop working within 15 days.Poor service. They didn't replace. Without giving any reason.Even after proper handling it is same as cheep China product.
"Good tought quality and comfortable to wear. If you want to have a durable earphones and want to do running and gym, go for it."
"I had puchased this item on 14-03-2021.Initially it was ok and functioning very well. But now only one earbud is functioning and the other is not. As per terms and conditions ,the item has 1 year warranty. I want it to be rectified or replaced by a new one by amazpon.How to return the item?"
Sound quality is really ok ok. Not up to the mark as far as the boat series go. 225 has much better bass quality and noise cancelling ability. Not for long uses. Hurts the ears after about two hours.
They have improved sound quality a lot. Some pple disliked it but it has even better bass so don't worry. Close your eyes and tune into nirvana.Edit: That black pouch bag is really handy and looks great.
"Pros- Has good base 5/5Good noise cancellation 4/5Perfect fit 5/5Has a cable clipCons- The earphones have average buil quality, the wires are not braded at all. 3/5The earphones have very much high volume than needed 4/5Get tangled easily 2/5Overall - 4/5"
After few months it's not working properly I'm purchase 2 times found same issue
"I'm rating for this product after one month of rough use.I'm not a bass lover but I liked it's sound quality and it's attachments with my ears .This is my first earphones which is better in comfort with me in my daily routine work.When I run it doesn't out of my ears.I'm disappointed by it's mic position, it sometimes doesn't deliver clear voice to other.This happens like 2 times over 100 times of use.Overall I'm very impressed with it."
Bass is not good and you have to tweak with equalizer for good music. Build quality is fine but after long usage you will feel slight discomfort in the ear. Green color is good.
I will never buy products made by Boat. Really bad quality. The volume button stopped working after 3 months of moderate use. Where Sony headphones lasted me 2 yrs and is still better than boat.
I'm really like this earphone. The sound quality of the earphone is very good. It have Awesome bass sound but one disadvantage is ear pain. When im using this earphone long time I feel pain because the ear pots size is too big
"I am fallen in love with this earphone. Earlier, I have boat 225. This sound quality in this one is superb. The base and trible are well balance and you can feel the sound clearity in this one. This one is better than boat 225. This is my 2nd boat product, I really happy with the products from Boat."
The product is worst.. It just worked for 2 weeks and then got issues while making calls. Boat services has become really bad now. I won't recommend to buy boat products. Services were good before but now its really bad. There is no option to even replace the products from home. 👿👿👿
"The sound quality of the product is good enough to listen to good music, or simply talk hands free.However noise cancellation is not as per what is claimed by boat. Good enough to use to listen to music or use even as a hands free device."
"You can have a good quality of sounds. Basic things you can do well. Music, calls isn't that great can see a room for improvement.  Overall packing is good, different sizes of ear buds is a good addon"
"Update: after using for 2 months the dust filter on the earbuds came out, the mic stopped working and the protective part of the Audio jack also started peeling off please don't buy these earphones🙏🤧."
"so the bass is quite decent BUT I need to press the earplugs with my fingers for that.. and because no-one can really do that all the time, the sound quality and bass just deteriorates as soon as I stop pushing the plugs in my ears.so it's the design for me, its not working out"
Don't choose this blue colour because this colour earphone's wire is not graded and ear tips are also very delicate and make plastic kind of sound while inserting into ears. Sound quality is ok but call quality is very good. For PUBg it performs good but go for realme buds 2 for better experience in pubg.
"This product is really with have some good music production by an Indian brand... As per its cost it brings a very beautiful design, specially music production system either vocals or bass it will amaze.. i dont know others whats think but in my view its worth every penny..😊uh can go for it.."
"Today i received the package and  I heard it so first only right side I could hear,  then after adjusting I could hear the left side as well and one more thing the buttons on the headphones for volume key, in case of decreasing the volume the volume increases, it should not happen that way. kindly check"
Within couple of months of use mic was not working.Wires are very thin.Please put some more money and buy some better headphones
"Balanced sound outputLight weightTangle free cableAt just 399, awesome price"
Built quality is superb.But coming down to real deal “sound”Sound signature is “pathetic”Imbalance “trouble” Make sound 💩.I have used 4 different headphones from boat.Rest are really good.But this one is crap
The earphone is so big doesn't fit it ear the sound quality is also not so good enough.. not recommended
Punching Bass. Looks good. Wire doesn't look sturdy so would need to be careful.
Only reason i bought this was because of the 1 year warranty. The sound quality is not that good. Impedance is low. Sufficient for meetings and calls. That's what I use it for.
Its a very nice product for regular use & for sports person. I also have a Boat Rockerz 600 Kunal Rawal Edition so I should not compare that one with this because that is superb but it is also nice as a earphone in this range and it also has a nice bass & it is better that boat bassheads 225. It looks very cool too. Its worth buying ♥️
"Although the earphones were good but they stopped as soon as I started using them. There customer support is very bad. They dont do pickup or deliver product if ur u r claiming warranty. Moreover, boat is a good company my last earphones was of same model and it worked for more than 1 year but this one is not working properly."
"Hi there,I just received this Earphones today & it is amazing , apart from one thing.When i connected it with my Laptop, everything else was perfect the only problem I faced is that volume buttons were not working on it instead it was working on mobile phones.So just want to know is there any issue with it  or it (volume buttons) will not work on Laptops?Please assist further on this."
The left earphone has stopped working within 2 months and out of the return window so I'd suggest not buying if this earphone is this badly unreliable
This is very good earphoneVoice quality goodAll thing goodJust 1 problemIt don't support micOnly in my phoneIt support in others phoneBut that's my earphoneAnd not support in only my phone
"it looks nice , sound quality is good but no bass. Apart from these, when i use it for calling the mic need to hold for clear voice even noise cancellation system and buttons work properly ... finally i dont satisfy with the product and company's return policy because i want my cash back but one can only replace it with other similar item , so think before buy it"
"Worth of buying! Value for money. As expected, another good product from boat under low budget! If u want to buy headphines under 1000 i would recommend this!"
Best earphone under 400rsFiting so good for earsSound and bass quality more than i expected 🥰
Using both realme and this one . Go for realme if you want bass . To save 150rs with little downside and very little bass reduction go for it.Cons : plastic used in it looks very cheap.
"Earphone, quality is good but now ear-friendly because its lobes cause pain.if you want to use it during exercise, well and good as it holds with ear tightly but it seems disadvantage when using whole day like me. ear starts paining. for that use without lobes.Rest,it is best with this price"
"Excellent sound quality and perfect fit in the ear. And the cable length is 3 feet. So, very comfortable to use with a phone in any pocket.Looks so stylish and bold."
The ear-wired phone stopped working within 2 months.  Last time also I had a bad experience about Boat headphone.  I have come to the conclusion that retailers sale faulty earphone on amazon. Beware of it.
In the beginning it was working really good but within 6 months it started having problems..I am disappointed.. Don't buy
"Overall this ear phone is good but boat can also provide us earphones without these uncomfortable thorn, realy hate it.I love jbl and one plus kind of super conformable earbud design."
Sound quality is need to improve. Some distabance is there in head phone while hearing a music. Bass sound is not good. This can be replace. It will help dull to me
"It's a very beautiful and lovely looking voice quality is good awesome,It's a very beautiful and lovely looking voice quality is good awesome,It's a very beautiful and lovely looking voice quality is good awesome,"
"I've tried a lot of Boat products, the sound quality of this earphone is mindblowing. It gives you clear audio with boosted bass however the quality of the material is not that satisfying. If you are looking to buy a Boat earphone then go for Bassheads 220. That product gives the quality of material as well as sound."
"One of the worst product I  got it from amazon it disappointed me , after received from amazon within 3 to 4 months it is stopped working I lost my money"
We received the product by amazon and found problem with mic key..problem is that when I increase its volume then it increase but when decrease its volume then it same increase means in bith condition volume only increase..
"I'd prefer other earphone in this category, like MI wired, quality isn't great on this one compared to other Boat earphone around this price point, this are bigger than normal in ear, only positive I think is water resistant and that'l too I've never came across to use"
This is my second time for getting the boat headphones before this I ordered boat rockerz 450.This headphone is really value of price.The sound quality is very much good .The wire is braided at and it has also made up of a good quality.As always boat nevers disappoints me.If you are looking for a earphone under rs 500 you should definitely go for boat 242.
"Boat headphones are really good at the given price point. I use them for calls, watching videos and music. Right from day one of purchase I am using heavily but they are not getting tired. I recommend to buy. As promised Bass delivery is excellent, feels like an open theater with heavy sound."
More efficient than boat bassheads 225 as it has volume control buttons with pause and play button and stick to ear better than 225 and the sound quality is very good and in 449 it is value for money. I will recommend this product for people to wish to buy wired earphones under 500.Sound quality is very good as i have used it for 2 months its functioning good till date. Noise cancellation is better than boat bass heads 225.
I just bought this as my preference was to have a headphone which has volume controls.
"Build quality is very good. Best ear phones in 400 price range. Vol control, mic everything is working well. My previous bass head 150 lasted one year after that I have ordered these based on my sports gear usage. Very comfortable for walking, jogging, running."
"Writing review after using for 5 months. Go for this, after all made in India, soft quality and strong also."
the some quality is very nice bases is Boom. Super Bass and we can easily pick up calls and cut if you are music lover then you should buy this product it is value for money.
I'm a person who don't use much headsets and I don't like to invest much on headsets.I have only used headset range upto Rs.350 .I bought this at Rs.499 and it worth every penny. My colleague suggest me this and I also loved it
"Its 12th day and buttons of the ear phone is not working.Automatically sound goes high or min.Cannot use during phone call, because other end cannot hear me.Sound quality was OK.Worst product from boAT for me this time..Highly dissatisfied.. 😔 My money in Vain..😠"
The sound quality was good but it was uncomfortable in my ears and the 3.5 mm pins plastic holder is very weak. After one and a half months of use it started to malfunction and continuously started to decrease the volume of my video and game. I tried everything even kept it in rice nothing worked. Not a good product.
"Good earphones. Though I'm getting good sound with earphones attached to mobile phone, same I didn't get on attaching to laptop. It had a weird sound. I had to partially attach to achieve the purpose. Sometimes bass is too much, I've to pull out earphones partially to hear the sounds correctly."
It's music quality is perfect but it's not a durable for even more than 6 months. I've ordered 6 times to this same earphone but every time I've feel dissatisfaction because sometime it's microphone not works and sometime it fully stop to work. Now I can say that it gives short time happiness. That's all.
Really loved the product. Nice sound quality. Bass is not upto to the level but descent. Mid tones and high tones are really mind blowing. But over all good product
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
 This is super earphone I m writing review after 6 month
"Decent with price but not comfortable.If you listen for a long time, you may get ear pain or damage your ear too.This is loud with too high bass.If you have low budget, so you should to buy this. Otherwise i will not recommend you. Thanks"
"I got the product as shown. Good sound, felt light weight on my ears than my previous JBL earphones, best part is its bass, I'm a bass head So I'm satisfied with the bass for that price."
After 4 months left side handsfree was not working so got it changed from Boat service centre instantly. Really impressed with the quality n service both
It is a very stylish earphone provided by boat in this price range. You can definitely go for it. You will get amazing boat warranty service also of 1 year. Sound quality is decent. Stylish earphone. Go with the green it is more stylish and highlighted.
It is not comfortable in ear. I bought this for Long 2-3 hours of continuous use but it's not comfortable. And starts paining after 1 hour of use. But the sound quality is awesome. But I recommend you all to buy Realme buds 2. Realme buds 2 is a great product and no one is near to that product.
Go for moto or redmi or philips. this boat series you would hate it just from the first song you listen
"I got surprised at this poor audio quality... Wasted money by buying this in a deal, cannot be returned because I bought it in a deal..."
"Superb quality, everyone must to buy"
Worst ear will get a severe pain after using for 30 minutes due to supporters and if we don't use supporters these are very sloppery.and headphone jack haven't last even a month got replaced by boat
Whenever on call it is making some noise to the other side of the caller.I have experimented it and found out this problem. The customer service people are telling there may be problem in the phone.
Best under 499 awesome looksAwesome sound qualityDont see any other products under 499 just go for this one I took the active black colourOne excellent quality carrying pouch is also provided for free that looks dope
"Very nice product. This review is after a month of usage. Good bass as expected. Got the original output after using 2 days. This can be easily recommended to others. It is worth for 500 Rs.Good sound quality, bass, build quality.3 buds are given of different size.But sometimes it would come out of ears easily.As of now this s best under 0.5k😀"
Boat never fails to fulfill my expectations .I personally love their products .you should go for this .worth your money 💰 and the bass is just indescribable the ear hooks are really helpful in case ur jogging or in a mood to hoove with music 🎵 then surely go for it as I did😊
"What a bass, specially i am a bass lover and this product is crazy for bass lover. Noise cancellation is very amazing due to those rubbery ear hooks. They fit very very well in ear. I seriously can't feel any disturbance and pain in my ears after a long time of usage. These are very very very value for money ."
"I had buyed this earphone 1 month ago, It came up with amazing packaging. I use this product 3-4 hours a day and is working nice, sound is loud and clear, build quality to great good for rough and tough use. Also color is attractive, highly recommended in this price range."
"Good one. The passive noise cancellation is good. I could sense the mids and highs better. I have Bose sound sport wired, Boats comes close to this. i love the fit too. No pain on ears even after using for more than 3 hrs. For this price, this is a steal. The volume control also works well with IphoneX."
"Awesome headphones under 500rs.Best audio quality, good noice cancellation, and clear voice via microphone when on call.Ps. Just remove the rubber stopper if u have sensitive ear cause it paons after continus use for at least 2-3 hrs"
Not good quality.Speaker stop working in 1month.Not comfort fit in ear .Bass is not as expected from boat series.Sound quality is also compromised.
Good product but after 3 month of using this ear phone one side speaker is not working any more.
Nice sound clarity... loved the product. 😍😍😍😍 thanks Amazon.but the clip was missing with the product As I ordered for someone else I got to know about this later.
I have to say product is very good in both build and sound quality but in sound 'treble' is worst then I expected treble is bad I can't imagine from this brand. I have to paly this in 70-80% maximum volume otherwise sound will get very noisy. So think twice before buying this product.
"Writing a review after 9 months of continous use.> Bass quality is excellent> Wire is durable, not cuts/tear till now> Earphone is lightweight, no trouble to ears even after a long useBoat is doing a great job, without any doubt THE BEST."
"After usinh for one month, First of all the cover is not going to adjust your earphones you have to fill it like u do when your space is over , else audio quality and mic is working well sometimes the holder hurts but thats managable. Overall 4.5Star product in this price the product is fabulous"
"Bad build quality.. After 1 month it was Not working and i cant claim the warentee.. worst earphone under 500.. I think Amazon is providing Refurbished or second hand earphone as i Ordered many earphone, maybe  they are providing me duplicate earphones.. Never suggest to buy this types of earphone"
The sound quality on phone calls is not good. Mic is also not very good for voice calls.The contact is also keep getting loose between jack and port. Needs adjustment everytime for a good contact between jack and port.
"If you are extreme Bass Lover Go For Bassheads 225This earphones had HD Balanced soundBest For Gaming, Jogging and GymsYou will get crystal clear HD sound from itEx. HD Sound of Footsteps in Pubg and cod,It's BoAt, Don't Think Go for it!!!!!"
Perfect in every prosperity.1.sound2. Fit3.base4. Wire quality is too good .I must say it's perfect in such price range .
Quality is very good. Sound quality is nice. Bass is laid but vocal hides behind a little.Wire quality is great. No pain in ear after long usage. Grip is great and holds earphone in place always.Clip and pouch are nice addition.
"Amazing sound quality. I have got a boult space headphones which really hurt ur ear when worn for even 10 mins. Also got a jbl c200si which i got for 850. This is good but with a volume control and the kind of clear bass, it is simply amazing find for 550rs."
"2 weeks, and the only problem I faced is that I'd have liked a better clip, and also a cable tieEarphones give no problem, stay on even on full sprint."
Overall its ok. If you want good bass this will be bad choice. The clarity is good. Dont have usual problem with the cable breaking till now. Its been 6 months. But the plastic casing of plugins may brake since it's not that thick. May hurt the ears while wearing the helmets. For the price range its ok.
This is the second time I'm getting the earphones in the last two months.... The product quality is low .. the earphones connection point just got bent so easily after putting it in my phone ... Now there is a problem with the sound ...Boat please improve the quality of the product.
I am using POCO F1 which has great jack output and equalizer. Combining these earphones with them makes listening music so good.No brainer! Just go for it.
"This is only good for taking calls, not good for music at all. The higher end frequencies get distorted a lot.For the price range it is a good product though, you get a clip and pouch, packaging by Boats is really good."
"Packaging  was not good and there's some kinda hair inside the earpice box, earpiece feels like a cheap product in some areas like volume + -, joining\diversion of left&right buds wire.. sound and bass quality is good but not the best in this price segment."
"I am writing this review after one month usage, I found packaging was goodInitially it worked very well exactly after a month it stopped workingI found its a waste of money as its non refunded"
"Sound quality-The low frequencies are are decent, however things start to sound muddy with anything over 2k Hz and it gets worse the higher it goesBuild-I have no complaints as far as the build goesSweat-proof-This is a lie. The buds are splash resistant, but the mic and button box most definitely are not. I use them while running and the sweat from my body has short circuited it"
"Bass quality is good. Light and comfortable. Noise cancellation is average.It provides a surrounding sound efect like a theatre. But overall sound quality is good and justify its price.The only problem is, it doesn't work on every smartphone even with the same jack point."
It's a very good product 👍 It's been a month using it it works excellent the only thing is that the earbuds are very loose like they lost very easily so take care of that well company provides more earbuds in box so I have no problem... 👌
I like the earphones. They are pretty much good at this price. But the only one thing is my ears started to pain for longer hours of wearing. The sound is good. Basically I am not a bass listener. So i don't need it much. Over all you can take it at this budget
If u want to buy an earphone please go for this prodouct....But for the bass lover it is not what you want but for a normal person or just for gaming you can definately go for this product .I have ordered this product 2nd time and trust u will not gonna disappoint ..(Highly recommended)
It is not durable at all me and my brother bought these earphones and  it stop working after 2 months. If you compare it to other boat earphones there are many better and durable earphones. Don't go to its looks it is not worth 500 ru. Its bass is good but there are more big issues with it. Don't buy.
Please dont buy very poor  quality. One bud is not working. There is no replacement. No refund. If u want to waste money then buy in amazon or else buy somewhere. Boat is a good company but amazon spoiled its name by bad service.
not good.There is no return policy for this item.If you don't like this then you need to throw it there is no other option.weird!
"Good product by boAT. Its just that you can't put the earphone for longer time, as it give a little pain."
It was in good condition and the sound quality and noise cancellation and noise cancellation was satisfactory. But what was unfortunate is the rubber thing wears off at the ends after repeated usage and boAt service centers are not that easily accessible.
My product has not been working prooerlyProduct is not good. Earing problem found not clear sound anदो mice probelm.Hence requested to you kindly send me another piece. So that we can faith for your product.I hope you can helo help us with this regardsFromRajendra Murlidhar Bangre
Amazing..... I brought this earphones for my frnd on his birthday as a gift and earphones are mind blowing 😍😍 in a price range of 500 i will suggest u to buy this earphones but if you have low budget like 300 400 then u cann but xaiomi earphones those are also very good at its price segment
"If you're downgrading, it's not gonna be a good experience. It's not very^ clear but okay if you dont care much about sound quality. Price is reasonable."
"Amazing 70 days experience, so good .Amazing noise cancellation and durability, it fits in my ear perfectly 👌😍, sound is very smooth and clear with good bass 😍,After 2 months of use its ear buds have became loose , but all over its is far better than 225❤️"
I have purchased recently on sep 2020. It has been supported to my note 5 pro & PC as well as .
"Don't like the excess bass overshadowing the songs, not my thing, also not as comfortable to the ear as expected."
It's true to its color shown in the picture and looks really funky. The rubber buds stays on the ear and doesn't slip away. I like the sound quality and no issues with the earphones whatsoever. A very good buy. I have been using it for a few months now and works amazing !!
i have bought this product twice in 2 year . Both are same in sounds quality which is really good .but Previous earphones which was damn good in physical condition. The latest one which I bought has not that much good at physical. Qualiy has decreased in hardware
I am giving only 3 stars because as per rhe advertise the product does not perform up to the mark. There was some disturbance in the music a continuous low frequency static sound was persistent . The build quality was also compromised as boat used plastic the feel was not good . The product seemed fragile to me.  But if you trust the brand BOAT and that you Should I recommend The boat Bassheads 225 .
This earphones has good volume. Nothing else. The sound quality is average. Bass is ok. boAt Bassheads 225 is so much better at this price range. And good luck if you're gonna put this earphones on for hours together. The edges are bit sharp and hurts your ear if you wear it for too long.
"Just go for it , I actually bought it for gaming and it’s damn clear I can hear where the footsteps are coming for and music is so great it’s like I am in a live concert and it is very comfortable in the ear so just go for it!!!,"
"This earphone does not worth the price, only the packing is good otherwise the product doesn't have a clear bass and anything that the company have described!"
Worst noise cancellation. Sound quality is not justifying the price. I felt like listening with road side earphones. Bass is okay.I can sense some disturbance even with HQ music.
"The plastic grip near the pin needed to be a bit big and made of a material that does not slip out of fingers. Unplugging the earphone seems a very bit problematic.Otherwise I'm really impressed by its bass, sound quality, gaming experience, noise cancellation, mic and overall build quality."
The quality is cheap but the sound quality is average. Nothing about this earphone is to talk about other than its value for money. I use this for short periods of time just for some online meetings and for an emergency backup
As always Boat is BossJust can't change tracks with the help of this is the only consOr else best product as always by Boat
Just buy these earphones i got these earphone in 349 rupees and they are worth it sound quality is best bass is bestes comfortable 1 year warranty and very affordable bass is incredible in this price range quality of material is good i just love it 😍😍😍😍😍😍🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
"Good quality earphones, the wires are a bit on the flimsy side. Could have improved on that as it gives the feeling that it will get ripped or break after a while."
"It has the best sound quality and the bass also good, only bad thing in this is, you will feel little pain and irritated for log ussage use maximum 75 to 80% sound fr better feel if you use 100 % of sound,  you will get the headache."
"Man, this is not really worth 500. Very poor quality. Only looks are good. Can't say the same about sound quality. Should have gone for something in the range of 1000rs."
Don't buy not recommended as it will stop working after 1month got the replacement but replacement is also not working now so don't think of it
"It's almost going to be a year after buying this but one of the ear's sound got damaged. I never let it come in contact with the water but suddenly one day one of the ear's sound was glitching but it became normal. But the next day, only one ear was workingI don't recommend this its low quality"
I have sony mdr xb55 and now bought this for common usuage where bass and quality doesn't needed much. This is 550rs and it worths the money we give i even used samsung earphones and akg ones which are a bit costlier than this but this is equivalent to that. When comparing to my mdr xb55 it is not a worthy opponent but remember the price. If u have money go for sony or stay with boat.
Not worth the money. It's ok if you would use for 3 hours for gym or any other activity. Your ear would start aching after 3-4 hours which is uncomfortable. For gym it's ok other than that the bass quality is not good. Other products are better at bass. But if you want a mediocre earphone this is it. At cheap price.
Okay So this is a must buy product. At this price point the earphones have very good fiting style which is helpful for doing sports while listening music. The BASS quality is reaally nice. And lastly the sound quality and the noise cancelling is good too........... So You Can Depend On This Product. (REVIEW AFTER 3 MONTHS OF USING THE PRODUCT)
"Ear buds are too brittle and left one broke down in 1st week (image attached).I am giving 2 stars bcz sound quality and wire was good, otherwise 1 star.Now I don't know if warranty includes breakage or not, I would want to return it or at least a replacement."
"Not up to the level, my colleague bought this at 499 which was good and this one i bought in offer, but not as like that"
"First i used some local headsets. And buyed a pTron headset for 200rs..totally disappointed with this headsets...after buying this headset at this price, i realised that sound quality is 4X than other headsets..So if you want a good headset with low price, then go for it.."
"This is Wonder full product but I purchased June 2021 but after 5months Its not working properly, left ear phone not working at all, It has 1year Warranty but when i try to reach them through, Boat costumer service i didn't get good helpfully reply. from the service center"
Best one in around 500 quality is good compared to other who range 500-1000 bass is great you will never regret buying this one
The performance of the headphone is osm but i got disappointed with one thing that the audio filter mesh gril falls off with use over 5 months due to poor anchorage and there are no such spares available with the package as well as in Indian markets too!Totally frustrated with heartless to buy another headphone for this simple unsolvable problem

" Bought at 350 ,it's good . For pugb it's good ."
"3 4 month use kind of product. This one is the third one in my family, not a single one cross 6-month time. Even exchange karne ka baad bhi, dono ko mila kar 1 saal nhi ho rhe warranty ke. Quality wagera thik hai but kya kare uska jab chalna hi 3 -4 month hai."
It worked very well for 2 months but than one side of the earphones started creating issues n dSound became very wired needs adjustment with the wire. Please don't buy
Such a cheap quality earleads Aman youth wants colour and looks but never compromise with quality.
"Very nice product sound quality, mic clarity, bass all are good no doubt, the best thing is colours are vibrant and very nice looking earphone.If you are looking for wired earphone must try this. You will not regret"
Product is awesome at any and every quality.  Its completely looking premium type. I am just enjoyinh it a lot. Thanks boat for such exclusive product. And also thanks to amzon. Headphone is awesome for gaming also. Noise cancelation is well. Then the other accessories are too good. And needed. Everyone should have a try

 I have used the boAt product. all of the ⛵ boAt product are fine and good quality....
"This are the best headphones u can get at this price range. Just go for it u won't regret buying this trust me.This has crisp and clear sound not like other headphones which are just bass heavy ,this has finely balanced sound with perfect amount of bass.🖤💯❤️🎧"
It's one of the best sounding earphones I've had I just can't believe it's such good quality for this price.
"Dnt buy this. It was not good and low quality wair and its suddenly struked voice and cant tald phns. Bass quality was very low and sound was good, good noice cancellation but main think i buy this proud and mainthink it was not working i used only one week right know not working worrest prodect dnt buy guys dabbulu bokka."
Sound loud clear good all  sounds ok but  treble is more distirbing ear if it is done good by company then it will becom good earphone
"Bass is amazing....noise cancelation is also good....about sound I want to say that with high bass, sound quality got low i.e. sound quality is not better ....but it's OK....It fits in the ear....have a good grip and do not produce pain in the ear because of soft ear buds.....It's totally worth it!!"
IT WILL BROKE FROM LEFT SIDE MIC PHONE PLASTIC.... BAD PRODUCT DELIVERED FROM VENDOR.... NEVER EXPECTED FROM AMAZON....ALSO RETURN WINDOW ALSO CLOSED WITHIN 4-5 DAYS... THIS TYPES OF BAD MANAGEMENT LEADS TO AMAZON POOR QUALITY
This is one of best product no doubt on that but it needs to improve. After using some days the sound of one side speaker especially the left side speaker started decrease.

 Dislike bad earphone boat
क्या करू म इसका ये 10 दिन के बाद एक earphone चलना बद हो गया now 10 days later he replaced and give me new one she will work properly thanks boat for replacement
"I ordered head set with proper protection, meant for workout purpose (like olive green) and got one without it. Also the packet recieved was open and sealed once. Not expected from Boat and Amazon. Disappointed"
"The product is amazing and value for money, and sound quality is excellent and at  reasonable price ,please go for it, trust me, just Awsum earphone"
Used it for daily calls and within 2 months of usage the Left side ear phone is not working.
Not seen so perfect headphones yet perfect sound quality and build quality value for money best buy.
There is nothing that i like speakers are like 200 rupees earphone and sound feels like something hurts your ear . So i Suggest every one to buy boat 225 bass headsEDIT3 DAYS AFTER REPLACEMENT ONE SIDE EARPHONE'S VOICE START FLICKERING (COMING AND GOING) SO PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS
Without cable clip &  price is cost when i purchase this item  shows the rate in AmazonRS.529/ after i booked the rate was Rs.399/- in this box there is  no MRP and Modelno.
"Selling broken products. My headphone did not have any accessory mentioned on the box like extra ear tips, free pouch and cable clip. The headphone was broken out of the box.Why do you sell the products that are already returned by some other person? Even after it being broke? Seriously pathetic!"
The wire may look braided but it isn't. It is just a normal rubber coated wire and isn't durable. I hope it doesn't break easily. Very uncomfortable for long use. The rubber is uncomfortable. The paint from the jack came out after 5 days of use.
Do not waste money on this. All it has is poor sound quality and terrible bass. The only thing loud in this earphones is treble. Please don't make mistake of buying cheap earphones to save some money because i regret it.
Products packet was old and already opened . It was like old package and old product . I was expecting better product . Earphone build quality is not premium as shown in photos and videos.
I'm using since almost one year and now reviewing so I found amazing . I never face any issue with this Earphone.Sound is goodBass is goodNoice cancellation is decentIt's value for money .
Complete Fit in Adult Ears.But one problem here only two colour are availbale in braided cable. (Lime Yellow & Black Red)Superb sound quality & clarity.Its also compatibility with Google Assisstant with OK Google.Also best build quality.
"Wow, what a earphone i got amezing bass treble. and sound main think ear fitting u can run, workout, dance everything before i had boat 225 model that also good but not fit in ear this is very good coating one of the main think water proof. Do not go blutooth earphone worth 1500. This is 550 if any sale u can get 450..."
It doesn't work the way it is supposed to but yet it is fun to use it and for calls I've never used an earphone that is this bad the person on opposite couldn't even hear me it creates such an echo or maybe it's just I got the defective piece but I hate it.
Good product form boat. I mean they can give competition to jbl also. Cuz their products are really up to the standard. And prices are very friendly.
Plz don't but this earphones beacusevthe special Additional thing given for holding in ears is not comfortable to wear and it's very painful 😖 to longtime use
"I was not sure while buying this hdphone but let me tell you this an excellent purchase at this price range.PAcking is attractive, they have given a pouch also. The highligh foe me was the sound quality. Exactly as I wanted from a hdphone.Certainly recommended."
Very satisfied with product. Sound quality is good. Bass is amazing. Boat is best out there. Nice buy and using it since 2 months Will buy again in future.
"Dear Amazon kindly shut your shop and get lost.  Your service,  Your product everything is substandard.  I got a defective product and when I applied for replacement I again got defective product.  Then I again applied for refund but nobody came to take it. Disgusting."
"Must be improvement needed. Music,Sound,Bass quality update needed. Value for quality."
Bekar service hai 2 ghante wait karate h fir 10 din baad aoo bolte....service cemter me bilkul bekar service dete....4 mahine k ander mera product prob dene laga aj gaya service center 2 ghante wait kia ....phir 10 din baad ao bolte ghatiya service h....nagpur sitaburdi f1service center me....
Sound is good. Noise Cancellation is not that much perfect. Still good for daily use.
"Boat 242 earphones have been my favourite earphones since my first order.Perfect earphones under the price range of 500. Amazing sound quality, mic is also really good, Perfect bass and the quality of the earphones,the non tanglement wire is really awesome. Totally the best earphones anytime under this price range"
This is the best and most stylish earphone at this range. It gives great sound quality (for normal not so intensive users like me) and also comes with a good warranty. Also many many good colours are available as options.Just buy it. Unlike many at this price range it has separate buttons for pause/play and changing sound levels.
"A great experience in this price range especially. Despite the name being BassHeads, the mids and high are not mushy.. Perfectly balanced frequency response for earphones of that low impedance and price. A great choice if you like perfectly balanced sound."
"So far so good, color could have been better,  looks like cheap typa plastic,  performance is good"
"Great packaging and sound is good for now i havnt tested in evry heavy bass song but it should perform nicely till now a very budget friendly bass satisfier for bass hungry ppl like me, comfortable and looks are also good overall for now a good purchase might add pros cons later"
This is the second earphone (same model and brand) I bought from Amazon within a span of 2 months and both have stopped working. Really frustrating. This is worst earphone till date I have used. Don't know how can this be Amazon choice
"I received it in good packaging.Bass, sound overall quality id good...Wire seems to be strong it has special coating which makes this wire strong.You can use it rough and tough...I recommend this..Value for money."
I using last 1 year. Good for ears. This product i used for above 7hr journey. No pain or irritation for ears. Sound not boat bass but stereo sound.
Khaan me bohat dard hota hai isko penne ke bad. I think not a good design. previously i was using Boult Audio bassbud X1 which much good then this in comfort zone. In sound Boat is good but very painful for ear because of bad design.
Paisa vasool. Overall sound quality and bass is awesome.Cute little pouch is also ok.Build quality could be better... more sturdy.
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
 Dont purchase
"Good product, sound quality is also good with good bass but as compared to boat bass 225, its not that good. One thing it has more stronger that boat 225."
Uncomfortable
I purchased 3 of these earphones and the sound is just amazing. Boat has impressed in terms of sound quality.I have been using boat for a long time and the sound quality is always great.
"I liked that base, its loud and for the people who enjoy high bass and about the musicals its low compared to jbl c100si,jbl c100si is low on bass its balanced.. U can go for boat as its quality of wire is good..Edit: after 2 month of use right side ome stopped working ,looking to get warranty claim :')"
The product got defective within warranty period. I've contacted the seller but they haven't responded to my email yet. After sales service is worthless.
"Awesome product from boat sound is just like boom,really very good earphone,if you are music lover then just go for it,and also the noise cancelling is awesome really good earphone everything's performance in this is very good.😍"
"Due to it's nice base quality, it's sound quality becomes very good.Noise cancellation works fine.Build quality and overall looks are impressive.Cable organizer doesn't woks well ( just OK ).Additional accessory in earpiece seems headache in the beginning, but once you start using for a week or two, you will like it."
"After using one month, the ear-phone is not working properly on my phone, and also earbud is not fitting properly in my right ear. I threw an invoice, that's why I can't claim the warranty. But, I've proof that I bought this earphone in the month of June 2021."
I am totally satisfiedSound quality is great and the thing i like the most about this earphones is it's weightIt's so light weight you will not not even feel like wearing any earphones..very much comfortable but you cannot use it for too long...when i use it for more than two hours continuously it starts hurting my ears
"This is a decent earphone considering its price. However, I am not sure about the durability. The mesh grid (dust protection grid) was damaged after 6 months of its usage. I would advise you to clean them often. Overall, the product is worth to buy."
"It is useful to listen music or for any day to day conversation, it seems little heavy, but it is really good during sports activities, it has very tight grip, Mic should be good, can't record any audio if connected with PC or Laptop, only best if you use it with mobile"
I buy this Ear phone and got it..when I hear the music its good but after sometime couple of days when it tried to call mic  is not working..when I try to contact support they are saying they can't help.They can't replace..So I lost the trust with Amazon...
Dont buy.. if you want to save your money.
The seller is selling fake product at the name of original one...They are selling fake products literally of 100 rupees ear phone sound quality..Thanks Amazon they have return policy..I am returning my earphone..Better to buy from some other seller
"Bass quality is very good, and sound is clear. You don't have to worry on the bass, you get what you pay. Previously used boat rockerz 255 bluetooth though experience was not so good. But this time is awesome. Anyone want to purchase go without thinking too much. Wire is also good to handle. But you have to be careful any earphones."
What I like about this product?- It have good sound quality.- It have good bass.- And it descent sound sealing buds.What I not like about this product?- It produces some weird noise.- And overall wire quality is descent.
"Actually it's only been 2 days since I bought them...so far it is good everything is awesome and I have been using boats bluetooth headphone ,bluetooth earphones and so far they always have come to satisfy me..so even the wired ones will be awesome I feel... Thankyou boat...I like the colour lemon green"
"Good overall experience be it sound quality or the make, it’s a decent proposition for the price one pays for this pair of in ear buds!!"
"Product is good enough but want to suggest one thing, if you want better earphones than it in lower price go for ""SAMASUNG-EHS64"" earphones......You can go through these earphones also beacuse they also deserve 4 stars at price of 500"
PL DO NOT BUY THIS AT ALLVoice not clear at all while on call.Also the control buttons do not work sometimesNot expected such bad quality from BoatCan not return as return period is over
"This product of boat bassheads 242 is excellent. I'm fully satisfied with this product. sound quality is amazing,bass in high volume is excellent,noise cancellation is good .this product performace is excellent and price of the product is also good also the design of the product is sprb. build quality is good."
Good purchase under ₹500 & no complaints since I started using it for few backs before.
"Product works perfectly.. but not enough bass for the price.. not enough noice cancelling, the 3.5 pin holder is small and very slippery material.. not able to unplug so easily.."
Waste product...one ear plug stopped working with in a month....waste brand bcos no option to claim warranty. The site throws an error...product not selected.
"Pretty average, both build quality and sound quality. But serves my purpose...Also the right earpiece is louder than the left one....dunno about bass n stuff coz I use it only for white noise while working"
"This is such a balanced audio product and such an unbelievable price. Build quality seems like above average. In short. It's a steal!! Way better than boat 225. BUT, inspite of all that, it doesnt last long. Durability is very poor."
"u can't use this earphone for long time even at medium sound settings..... This is only for Bass lovers, I never suggest this earphone( boat 242)  for melody songs...u better go with Realme Buds 2..BOAT BASSHEADED 242Bass quality---> 4/5Vocal quality---> 2/5REAL ME BUDS 2Bass quality---> 3/5Vocal quality--->4/5"
Well I got this around 350 in Boat sale on Amazon. Good to buy. Bass and noise cancellation quality not as I expected. Build quality is really good in the price range I must say this.
"It has been 2+ years i am using this product. This is what i call full paisa vasul product with minimal budget anyone can afford. Amazing voice quality.This will give you the experience of good quality sound effects. Not only quality wise but, built and looks wise this is awesome."
One side not working..2 month BHI Pura nhi Chala bhut hi bekar h isse Acha to 50rs wala HOTA h km se km 2 month to chalta h ye to 1.5 month me hi kharab ho gya
"I bought this exactly one year before , now its working only one ear like other cheap quality product. I didn't expect this from boat. Before this i used skullcandy earphone for 3 years and was superb."
I was using this for just 3 months and the left side of the year phone stopped working and the support system of boat India is not good as it is a Chinese company it bettter you ca go for mivi products or else boult .
Had high expectations looking at the reviews but these just very very normal ear phones. Sound is comparable to non braided cheaper ones
The sound quality is nice... Compared to the boat bassheads 225 this earphone is much more lighter as it is made of plastic as it designed to fit properly in your ear and as it's lightweight so it does not fall off.. some might find the in ear rubber irritative but u can take it out as well
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
" Great product worth the price, good fit, comfortable, good sound quality and noise cancelling"
"😡😡😡Very bad product, with 6months mic is not 😡😡working, and 7 months one side earphone is not working 😡 very bad pls do something, or else I am  going to suggest friends to not to buy this product, very worst experience 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡pls do not buy, if we get a call from Amazon they will tell that sorry sir, it's manumature problem ,pls do something"
"The product was working fine and didnot have any issues at first. but when the problem started with the left ear headphone, I tried to contact Boat via Phone, and sent 5 emails. I never received any response from them. I would recommend Boat not to advertise falsely to gain the sales targets."
"It's a good earphone, love the color and design. The bass is okay and I won't mind buying it again. Happy with the purchase."
I was expecting more bass..i trust Boat for its bass and sound quality...i dont know why they want to destroy their good reputation...they started compromising on sound and bass...not 100 % satisfied...Boat Basshead 220 much better...
"Sound and Bass was damn good but the product quality was not satisfactory, as you can see the image that I have provided. It was damaged near the right earbud. So I have requested a return, but there's replacement only."
Really a great product value for money and I am very impressed with the sound quality with noise isolation  I am very impressed with the quality of sound please go for it
"One side of the ear piece is not working sometimes. And call Accept/Reject, Voulme +/- buttons are automatically triggering, while walking with headphone on. Disconnecting calls frequently."
Do not buy this product its not upto the mark its uncomfortable to wear Tangled everytime but it was mentioned it tangled free nd very uncomfortable to use i'll give overall 2 stars its not worth it and there is no return option as they alredy kw its the wirst ever product
The name says 'Boat Bassheads' but I don't think there's enough bass to justify the name. Sound quality is good but not happy with the bass.
Best earphones at this price. Has a good bass and overall good performance with passive noise cancellation at high volumes. The peice I ordered had issue with one earpiece. I tried to replace but no piece where available so I returned them and since then I'm waiting for these pair of earphones to be available in stock
Overall it's a very good headphone sound quality wire quality everything is perfect about this and u are getting 3 different types of ear buds for which can fit children and adults
Great set of wired earbuds under INR 500. PROS:1. Doesn't pain even if used for hours.2. Protruding rubbery extensions are soft n helps buds to stay intact3. Really good Bass4. Wire length is good n it's nylon coating prevents interminglingCONS:1. Not great for treble lovers2. Noise cancellation is just okay
I purschased this headset 4 months before..now one side not working but i used very safely compare than other people.. Highly disappointed...
"There is no mic in the headset which makes it totally useless to answer calls. And the sound clarity is not so good.  Not worth the money paid.  If there was a mic, the sound quality i wud have compromised.Not worth  buy."
"Sound quality is averageBass is very lowTreble is decentGood for listening at very low volumeBuilt quality is good,Feels sturdy while handling, clip provision is while using voice call"
Sound quality is good and got it for 350/-. It is worth every penny. Jus go for it. Almost equal to my Sbuds+ 🙃
"ProsThis product has an awesome bass 10/10The coating on the wire is rich which makes it unbreakableBuild-in quality 10/10It also has a 1yr warranty cardIt also contains 2 pairs of earbudsConsWell , there are no cons literally"
Value for money. Worth buying.  Need to improve quality of cable (wire).  Quoting provided to the cables are very soft.  May not support for long run.  Otherwise quality is very good.
"This headset happens to be Just what I was looking for.It is quite Good in terms of ergonomics, properly adjustable in both the ears.Coming to sound quality, I am a huge fan of rock, bass and classical music. This headset hasn't disappointed me in neither of the genres.Decent headset at a decent price range."
"Don't waste your time thinking of buying this product, just go for it👍Amazing bass and brilliant sound quality, they even provide a nice pouch to carry this earphones, I bought this @499/- a few days ago, I'm more than satisfied with this product, thank you boAt and thank you Amazon🙏😇"
Not upto mark. The sound quality is like less bass and more terrible. This cannot be used for watching movies in mobile. We can't use for more than hour after one hour we will get ear pain or itching even in low volumeIam writing this review after 1 month of use
I want to tell you that don't go for this piece because my one side of this earphone stopped working just after 2-3 weeks and I am ver disappointed from this. The sound quality is adorable but this issue I faced has totally filled hate for this product. Not expected this from you boat.
Sound is too loud and starts to distort at full volume. It is unbearable to listen at full volume. Bass is not good enough. It's not worth its price. I have used Mi Basic headphones. They have better sound and bass balance than this one. Overall build quality feels cheap. Not good for music lovers.
I'm writing this review after 3 MonthsPros:Voice Quality is very GoodGood Bass andGood Design with Tangle Free WireCons:Noise Cancellation is to be improved but at this price ok ok
Using it from past 6 months and love it. Sound quality is good. Despite using it everyday for work for around 9 hours the quality is top notch with no cons faced yet. Worth the money. Affordable and good quality.
"Base sahi h mtlb thik thak, baki 100 rs extra me isse better option h.Or agar koi pubg ke liye lera h to bilkul mt lena yrr bhout bakwas h orr fitting se kan dukhte h vo aalag."
"The noise clarity is awesome.Bass is superb.Excellent build quality, perfectly fits in ear, recommended for workout person.The wire is truely tangle free.I am writing this review after 10 months of use but now its not working :-("
Everything in this product is waste. Firstly due to lockdown it took a month to get delivered to my location.. and secondly i didn't expect such poor work  from boat's side.. i was expecting a much better earphone as at this price i had many other better options.. completely defective and neither the bass nor the sound quality is good enough
"The reason for five stars is that there is no other earphone set like this one under 500 bucks, the sound quality is simply amazing and gives you a premium feel when you have them in your hands.On the volume of 56% it gave me a superb deep bass and amazing noise cancellation. Must buy if looking for earphones under 500 bucks"
Sound quality is not good when we keep full volume and bass is excellentSound quality -okBass-excellentOver all I am satisfied with the earphones under 500rs..
"This earphones has good bass, sound ,quality as well as noise cancellation is also good .It comes with three different earbud fittings with waterproof wire .Ear cushions r very comfortable.Its build quality is rough & tough.Good product for music lovers ."
"Horrible build quality and mic is 1/5  , you can't play PUBG, CODM or any game that requires mic, even on call the other person can't hear properly. Horrible experience I'm done with boat.I bought Realme Neo Buds 2 way better than this I swear"
Raw rugged and for harsh use.I use my headphones like they owe me money. For such abusuve treatment and blatant misuse of power these earphones have come a long way
"This product Is good but, I try boat basshead 225 They are very good then this product it's Jack is not angular so when I put my phone in pocket the sound get low from left side ,so I think don't buy this not all product are good sometime product get failed."
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
" Light weight, comfortable & very nice sound quality like bass, noise cancellation."
"Bass quantity is good. Though need to set the eq. A Bit but once you get the sweet spot, they will be great. Wire is also good and doesn't tangle much. Ear passing great and it does black quite a lot of outside noise. A must go if you need good listening experience in a budget price."
It is the best earphones I've ever had and even after dropping it in water by an accident it still works tho the bass is kind of average the quality is the best thing and you also get a little pouch in the box to keep it in it has awsome sound quality and overall quality
"Very good quality sound is clear, noise cancelling is decent, bass is good and decentWire quality is very good this one my second earphoneI am using this about 1 yearSatisfaction with this product"
I ordered this product and after 4 month it stopped working.. I raised a complaint with boat team.. They took my headset and it's almost 3 month I haven't received my replacement product yet.. I tried to contact boat service center multiple time but phone is not reachable and they are not even updating anything on complaint ID.. My experience with this product is really bad
"While talking on call or video call, it keep shifts automatically on phone mode and ear phone mode, multiple times have to remove from phone and insert. And most of the people on other side of the call they say,  have I kept my mic too far from my mouth? Sometimes it's volume and pause buttons works and sometimes don't."
"Good product for what it is priced at. Sound quality is quite good, not so sure about the noise cancellation bit though.The ear plugs are comfortable and do not hurt even after prolonged use."
"If you are a music lover then please do not buy this product. Output is almost 10% bass only and 90% treble. Can't play music for long. Good noise cancellation and fitting, that is why giving two stars."
"i was hesitating to get a wired earphone as my last wired ones malfunctioned in a few weeks of purchasing. this one has lasted for a few months now. i really liked the color options. i got the red one. the wire is very long, so thats a plus.  and really, really durable"
Everything about it. It's a fancy item than a working earphone
Sound is goodBass is not that punchyBut with boat metal earphones and plastic body earphones has a huge difference..Would always recommend a metal one if it is boat earphone!
Less durable than it looks but the sound quality is okay. You certainly won't get the quality sound which you will get from premium headphones but it definitely bearable.
I liked the product because of his tangel free wires and ear hooks.....and best company.....the company has replaced my earphone after 9 months......boat is indian brand.... easily trustable
"It's rough on the ears, it hurts just to wear it as the material is inflexible and kinda rough."
Just Buy it You won't be disappointed.Sound & Bass is great at this price.Built quality is cheap plastic but the sound quality is great.
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
 i like the product and condition... go for it.. i pay this for 440inr... but do not buy from appario retails pvt ltd...bcoz he gives me opened product...
The only thing that bothers is that it's slightly uncomfortable if worn for long durations.Sound quality is good though.Overall good product.
After a week of buying white portion comes off and its completely mad up of plastic holding in hand it feels like chep generic earphones and doesn't sound good at all if you have money then buy boat 255 but not this. Very dissapinted with product and cannot claim warranty on it as its white portion comes of they are considering as physical damage. Wire quality is also bad.
"I never thought that ""BOAT"" earphones would be that bad. The sound quality is similar to ₹50 local earphones. Poor bass , and caused earache only after approx 1 hr. of continuous usage. Only the look is better , which is of no use when the sound quality itself is poor. I had it returned it and  got my refund."
"It's okay kind of an earphone. I didn't find them that good, may be because I have used high quality of earphones. But for 500 bucks, not worth."
"Do not buy this 3rd class product at all, this is worst ever product I have seen,"
Mic stopped working after 2 months. It's not sweat proof atleast mic housing is not. Sound 3.5/5 Durability 4/5 Design 4/5 Value for Money 3.5/5.
Very less durability and don't use it during workout ...the sound was okay for a month but after that it started getting worse and now it's not working ...I called the service center for warranty ...hope they respond as it's my mom's hard-earned money ... To be honest very bad product that's why is so cheap
The bass is very poor. Shriller sound when listening to music.We have 3 boatheads. Best quality sound is boathead bass 225. it's flat cable ensures it's tangle and tear free
Too much bass..no original sound at all..sometimes aux connector doesn't works with laptop..use and test someone's headphone before buying it..
"It's a goof earphones at this price range.. Good enough for songs, movies and all.. But not good for playing games.. Like BGMI its treble is little inaccurate.. Base is good.. Maybe because its not dual driver earphones.. Still 4/5 rating.."
"After lot of review, i zero down on this product. i have been using this headphone for 4 weeks, before writing this review. If you are not very sound bass conscious, this meets all your requirement for listening and speaking."
Im writing review after using for 2 months .. it Came with nice packaging .. also they gave boat pouch to carry earphones .. which looks premium.. i roughly used them still there is no change in the sound quality .. sometimes there is problem of jack that we have to adjust by twisting but no problem after that..
"good product, been using it for months bought for my sister also after using it for a month one of the sides stopped working got replaced from boat, warranty service, pickup of earphone and delivery of the replaced was very good and convenient!!"
I did not like the product the first time I ordered one side of the earphone wasn't working.Then I replaced the productOther time the jack wasn't connecting properly there is some issue with this model . But all thanks to Amazon and the seller they helped me in the returning this so easily ❤️
The earphone was green but the clip was white and the carry pouch was red and black not sure but looks like the box was opened and resealed
Good sound output.Noise cancellation features.Dedicated volume up and down button.Multi-function mute and pause button.Good bass.Water-proof.
I bought it on sale for 399 ..if current price is above thi s..wait for sale and then buy it ..amazing sound at this price ..best
Worst product! 1 bud is not working after 6 months of use
Dont buy Boat products as service is too poor and no more direct numbers at site...i have sent my head phone for replacement in May still no update from service center.. Almost 3 months iam still waiting for headphone...where to go for support
"Great sound quality, great design, really good fitting, has a large choice of colour too. if you want to buy a wired earphones I would highly recommend this one. They have everything which you could ask for!!"
"Mind blowing Boat product I'm giving 5/5 ratingVery good HD Sound and especially  looking,built quality and cable double cotting Exlent...... That one very Attracted to me hahahah 😂 .....  second time I'm  buying from boat ..bcz I'm loving boat company products that's why .....😍😍😍😍😍😍🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏"
Though i can listen properly but while on call other person can't hear me. It's still in warranty period. Tell me what to do
"Quality is good but ear get paining after hours of use (this could happen to different by persons to person) , well I really want evenmore bass quality but for time being it's good enough at this price 👍 hope it my review helps to everyone ."
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
 Not a good quality.Not worth spending money.Barely lasted for 6 months
Received used and damaged product. Its seems too ugly and someone used for longtime and damaged.Wrost experience.
The headphones are good from sound output perspective. But the product is very flimsy and ear phones broke very easily. Not robust
I felt bad about thid product..After usage of 2 months..the mic is not working..i felt bad for this..i contacted the customer care..but no response..I really felt bad for this kind of issues.
"Good product, Sound as usual perfect and noise cancellation good with perfect bass"
I ordered this first time but due to some accident it got damaged that time I thought the cables would had a cut but to my surprise the cables were fine there was no any cut but right side speakers got broken. So I ordered the same for the second time. So satisfied and a very good product and worth for its cost. Best for travelers.
If you want a Good Bass Earphones then u should definitely go for this one ... So clear sound Bass was so Powerful feeling like a Sennheiser earphones in ear ... Just close your Eye's and go for it ... Also you will get a Small Bag for keeping the earphones from Boat !! One of the Best Earphones
Overall Good quality noise cancellation is very good and bass is okay not very high but okay thank you team amazon 🙏 🙏
"Bought it 3 ½ months back, sound quality is more what you would expect. But left side of bud starts giving flat sound instead of bass. I claimed for warranty now I'm get replaced with new one without any charges"
"Used it for 2 months....Go for it guys.....its a gud product from boat you can use it while riding bikes or doing any other work, the hooks that sit inside the ear is very helpful and prevents the buds from falling......bass is above average but you could not expect much, but the product worth the money you pay"
Ordered them a month ago and the left earpiece has already stopped working. Handled them with utmost care but they still broke down in a month. I will suggest you guys not to get tempted by the looks and to go for boat bassheads 100... They have superior sound quality and are cheaper than this one.
Im note a bass lover i prefer balanced sound. Due to high bass it's dominat over Vocals and mids. If you listen vocals or you are a musician you'll feel bass is bit high. Built quality is very good protected cables. Mic works good. Buttons are tactile. It's hard to tie them and put into the cary bag though they have given it that's good.
"I always find annoying adjusting the wires and falling out of earplugs but this....the thing I loved was comfort level , it doesn't fall out from your ears and the bass quality is really nice.Go for it. Even if you are first time user."
"It wasn't exactly like what I was expecting.Sound is reasonably okay for the price, but MIC quality is total bummer. I have replaced twice and still I face the same issue. No one here has commented on MIC's quality. I'm totally dissatisfied with this model.Sound Quality 3/5Mic Quality 1/5"
ProsStylishFits perfectly doesn't fall offGood wire but tangle free would have been betterSmall earbudsConsSound is slightly off compare to boAt basehead 220 not good as expected as it is 242I felt background music not clear compare to other ear phones (like sienhieser)Overall sound is good not better
"I am using this since couple of months and satisfied with the sound quality. It's great.Wires are of great quality, bass is good, clarity and dynamic range is excellent. This is water resistant and what more can you expect in this price range!"
"Buttons malfunctions very frequently, it automatically starts playing songs in my mobile and one side of the earphone stopped working within two months."
"I loved this earphone, its bass is also outstanding. Build quality is also very good. Suitable for jogging, its ear hook is made of soft silicon-based material that's nicely fit in one's ear canal. And the cherry on the top is its volume control buttons, which doesn't give you any brand at this price range. Just GRAB it."
"Sound quality, bass was good. I initially thought that I finally found the cheap and best earphones. But, right in 3 months, one fine day it stopped working. The contact number given here for warranty activation DOES NOT EXIST. Hopeless product."
The make and the quality of audio is good enough for the price . There is no problem with tangling of wires . But the design of in ear and fixation is very poor and the earphone keeps slipping off the ear . It is very irritating . I feel JBL is a better option even if it's a little more priced than this .
"I think it's just a durable version of the cheap earphones they sell outside railway stations. Sound quality is average, bass is poor and sometimes ear hurts even in low sound.Earlier I was using the cheapest earphone of JBL and that had awesome sound quality and superb bass (Yes, the cheapest earphone of JBL). Overall okay product."
This product from boat extremely worstNo quality of sound while in callSignal interruptionAudio is too clumsy may be audio drivers are corruptedIf anybody is bass lover then don't buy thisIf you'll later you'll regret
I bought in offer at price 399₹ at this price this product is so amazing.1. Great sound Quality I loved it2. Amazing Bass At 25% Volume I feel so much satisfied for music.3. No doubt about build quality it's tangled free cable.Buy if this under 500₹.
"Very poor product, its also non refundable. Please dont by it, if you want to waste your money then its the best choice"
These earphones are the best for gamers who play bgmi it helps a lot while playing it's mic is fantastic my team mates can hear me clearly and i can hear enemies footsteps easily! If you want best earphones in ₹500 you should probably check these ones out
Looks good. Cable looks sturdy. Pouch given is useful. Call clarity is good.But sound quality and bass is not even as good as some lower model Boat earphones.
Best headphones in this price range of ₹ 500. No charging nothing required. Wire is also comfortably long. Bass quality is awesome. Sound quality is also good.
"First of all got opened and used product. Secondly, thought to try earphones bt sound quality also disappointed. Full of Treble(98%) rather bass(hardly 2%) opposite to its name ""Basshead""."
Changing my review because one earpiece isn't working now . 1 .5 maheene me hi khrab ho gya
Ear phone are okay.but when ever I join online meeting. it produce so much noise through mic that I cant use it for meetings.only use for me is to listen music.Product might be good. but I had a bad experience with this brand.
In case of sound quality it's very good. But still the product I received was a defected it's controller doesn't work. And it was too late for me to notice that
"Super disappointed, it stopped working after just 2 months. This is beyond outrageous for a company such as boat, it even says 1 year warranty."
After using it for almost 2 months I have experience degradation in sound quality which is not expected from boat.
Stopped working within 2 months...Warrant claim is a long process which also requires a copy of the bill.. would rather by a more trusted and better brand..
"The sound quality is just crystal clear like boat always has. I am using boat basshead 100 from last 1.5 yrs and I loved it but boat basshead 242 is better than this has higher bass , easily fit in ears sound quality is osmAnd look so classiy u can definitely go for it. Loved this product"
"Best bass quality as always given by boat products. The bass is the best on this range. The treble and stereo is also working good. Once device settings are set and calibrated, provides best audio quality at this range. So all I can say is worth of money."
"Bought it for my son thinking that a low priced earphone is enough. But, this is amazing far better than my JBL earphone priced 1200. Going to buy one for me... Surprisingly very good bass effect.."
Audio = 10/10Mic = 10/08Bass = 10/10Overall very nice product by Boat for on the go music at reasonable price.
"Its price should be 400rsNo Doubt Earphone is good but sometime mic is not working which is quit bad and build quality could have been a bit thicker, sound quality good. its bass up to the mark."
Product is made of good product quality. But bass is not so good. But it does the basic job very well.
"Sound quality ,build quality and price wonderful.....it's a best deal  for one who want to buy a earphone for gaming BGMI and music listening in a such a cheap price..i have been using these earphone seen15month...still working like new one.."
"Good product under 500. average sound quality and bass.It's average build quality.Sound and bass is good but after 2 week using this earphone speaker  was damage automatically but boat service is so fast and good they repaired my product ,thank you."
"It's really faboulous earphone for me . It's sound quality too good . And especially it's mic.. just wow bcoz it's really help me for my online lecture .. The Delivery ma'am was too good . He is talking very humbly I really like it !!In Conclusion I just want to say ""What, a product """
"Ear buds are not very aesthetic and comfortable when wearing. The sound quality seems pretty good though. overall, average I would say."
Everything is good but when you put it in your ears it's so pressurized you can't even imagine there is so much pressure inside your ear like your brain would explode! It's so tightly packed wouldn't even give your ear a chance to breathe air! That's my most honest review. Sound quality and noise cancellation is at it's best!
It's been more than 6 months I've ordered this product and it's working really well. The sound quality is excellent and also the wires used for these earphones are of good quality and do on get tangeled easily. These earphones are worth buying.
"Awesome earphones, good sound quality , handy enough while travelling, good voice quality over a call , good noise cancellation quality because when you are listening to music even in the first level of volume you will not able to listen any outer voice which makes listening experience better.Overall a good experience with the earphones !!!!"
Friends please don't waste your hard earned money on this pathetic product.instead for bolt earphones.i used both.bolt earphones cost less than this and the build quality and bass and calls quality also too good than boat.
It's average decent product.. not much good..Sound is not soft..At high volume it's irritating & sound is not clear..
I use this for meetings and everything else audio... This is durable and dependable.
I used to for 2 to 3 days and I started to feel irritated because of the additional rubber support so I removed them. After a week it's earphone jack started geeting loose from them wire and in 2 to 3 days I was only able to hear from the left side the right side stopped working completely.
"At first i didn't find it comfortable to use because of that rubber parts used to fit perfectly in ear, but as it's removable. now it works perfectly for me Great bass and good overall sound quality."
"Yet the best earphones I used in my whole life till date.... In a really good budget. Perfect for workout, office calls,and anything you can think. It's all over best. Will rate it 5/5 without any misunderstanding. Perfectly stand on every aspect.you can go for it. Without thinking much."
I accidentally thrown these earphones in my washing machine didn't realized it only after I took out my clothes later I found my earphones inside the washing machine.. was worried that they wouldn't work anymore but lo!! They're still good as new 😀😀🙏  must buy!!!
Everything is good about this except the volume down button is not working as designed. Instead of reducing the volume it is increasing the volume. Bought two pairs and both are having the same issue.
Superb built quality  with above average sound+bass quality bought these after watching shark tank india 🤣🤣🤣
Very pricky feeling if you wear for more than 25-30 mins. I have tried changing the ear plugs as given in the original package. But no change at all.Not worth the money.
But the quality of bass is not appropriate with regards to price I dont suggest this to anyone who want high bass in earphonesAnd it is not so comfortable for ears it doesn't fit in your ear properly or if it fitted forcefully then it is painful for ears
I was extremely disappointed up on the boss bass heads 242. The best was extremely poor or otherwise it is a good buy for casual listeners if you like bass very much this is not a good choice for you please go with some other bass heads
It's been just 3 months of the usage and one side of the earphone has stopped working.Not sure whether warranty card has any meaning.Who will replace thisGiving 1 extra star because of its look.Else 1 🌟
"I was using jbl 150 , when comparing with that this headphone is cheaper but low quality also . Sound quality is ok , but not as expected"
"Within 2 months the mic does not work properly, lot of complaints from people whome I speak with about a huge amount of noise being picked up by the mic even though there is no background noise at all. Totally not worth it"
I bought three earphones from boat company. None of the earphones lasted for one year. I will never buy earphones from boat company.
"Sound quality, noise cancellation & bass quality, all are good. The box is classy. It also includes a little pouch, that is handy. I love it overall till now."
Still in warrenty
Bought this back in November 2020 it was working fine with good bass now it doesn't sound the same i am not getting the sound quality and bass i used to get.
Please don't buy it has very bad bass and wire is too thin it's not like shown on image ... Better go for realme buds 2 they have punchy bass... Didn't expect product like this from boat thought they were good in bass but its bass is really crap... And not good for gaming also
the problem with many sport earphone is that they come loose with movement. but this one stays tightly fit inside the ear.
As they promised that the quality of wire is too good but it is not.. the wire got damaged with in very short time at the joint as shown in the pic. When I got them (February)it works really good but after some months (July) the microphone of headset stopped working it is so disappointing 😒 I like boat earphone but this one is not good 👎
I was buy last year feb 2020. After 4 months earphone is not connect to mobile. Then i go service centre and replace it after replace it i was get new earphone. After 3 month this one is dead. Again i was go to service centre executive say is not replace. Finally i throw this earphone
Good noise cancellation and good sound quality. Not heard from anyone around background noise…
Good product quality is amazing but extra accessories are annoying like ear piece which is long feels like scratching my ear very often I removed it for better relaxation
Not exactly my liking of sound but pretty good if you like bass boosted earphones.I prefer more flat and unaltered sound.Mic work fine as expected.No complaints.
"Writing after 6 months of usage .. the sound is not clear, you will hear very uncomfortable scratch sound while playing music.. waste of money"
Bass and audio quality is good. Microphone is worst. People on the other side won't even hear what you are speaking. Barely they will hear you
"Regarding the price, this is as best as you can get. We shouldn't even compare it to more expensive models. Nice sound quality, excellent bass quality. Noise cancelation could be better, but it is a minor issue. If you are on a budget, just go for it."
महा घटिया... 6 महीने में ही खराब हो गया और 3 बार chacange करवा लिया तीनों बार सेम प्रोब्लम आ रही है 3बार में एक बार भी सही  प्रोडक्ट नही भेजा ऐसा लग रहा है जैसे मेरे ही इयरफोन को बार बार वापिस भेज रहे है 🙏अब परेशान होके इस इयरफोन को कचरे के डब्बे में फेक दिया 😡😡😡
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
" This is the best product I've ever came acrossI have used Bluetooth earphones, eardopes and air pods but this is best of them all with the insulated wires and u can even wear it for jogging . best!"
Neither doubts nor any complaint for BOAT company but it's a wired earphone so that it going to loose wired effect.. after 2 months left ear wire volume got reduced
Sound quality of earphones its good at this price point but it hurts ears after use of 1hr continue..so i dnt recommend anyone
"Speakers vibration of bass in 100% volume, Voice Exllent , Good Quality. Very very thanks to Amazon and once again Thanks to Seller person ""Appario Retail Private Ltd"""
This product is not worth as per their advertisement it stop working from his lest ear side and start disturbing while calling and listening musicand as per my knowledge it is still under warranty so we request you to please replace the same or repair the same.
"It's a good product., High base , clear sound , best thing we can use at higher volume, it's won't give you a headache as usual it's a big problem in other earphones. I loved it. . You can buy it. It's a good product 👍👍👍"
"Everything is good or say best in this price range but after using for 2 - 3 months I got problem with its mic, it stop catching sound and slowly it became useless so as per my experience it's not durable....So buy if only have to use for anything other than mic uses..."
Sound quality very good but after using 8 month left side's spekar ger worse.
"This headphone is bass boosted headphone ani light weight also. i liked it for music, but vocals are not that clear so I can't able to listen what the person wants to say and if I increase volume then it started affecting my ears badly 🥺"
this is now better after replacement one i have got earlier was malfunctioning the buttons of volume and pause & play not working and even mic was malfunction too just like amazon sent used defective item but after replacement it's better now
First of all the build quality is very good. The wire is covered with a rubber coating very strong material.The sound quality is very good the bass is good could have been better...as compared to other earphones.The Jack is not gold plated but does the job well no complains about that.Also the sourround sound is nice if you play games like pubg these are very good.I think it is value for money!
"The product is very pathetic, it won't even last for 10 days, bought it for my online classes though, the left headphone wire broke and the left ear is no longer working. Would not recommend at all, if you are looking for something durable, better look for something else."
Sound is good but design very bad your ears will swell after some time doesn't fit properly
"Bought the blue Variant! Value for money, just disappointed that the black Variant uses better material for the wiring and also looks cooler! The black material doesn't tend to accumulate smudge whilst the blue one hoards tons of it!"
ఇందులో ఒక ఇయర్ బర్డ్ నెలరోజులలోనే పాడైపోయింది. Waiste of money.నన్ను దారుణం గా మోసం చేశారు.
its nice and very good looking blue earphone but it does not cancelled baground passive noise cancelledin realmebuds 2 it cancelled passive noise so when you listen music in 60% volume there is no noise came from bagroundits good product  overall
I received them today in a good packaging condition ...The highlighting part of these headphone is it's build quality which is just awsome and it's in ear fit is also excellent...But the sound quality is not as superior as that of realms buds which comes at same price ...So looking for excellent sound quality don't go for it
"Overall an amazing product, have used it earlier too, but....Unfortunately the one I ordered had an issue with the mic button. The volume kept reducing to zero on it's own.The product comes with a 1 year warranty, so hope these issues would be resorted.Apart from that the product has been great in both sound and build quality"
"Noise Cancellation not upto the Mark.. Atleast We have it in budget Range So No problem.Bass is Not Heavy like Boat 225.Comfortable and lite Weight,Sound Quality is Good and Mic is Great..Finally Good in Budget Range"
"I tested it and found that this earphone is exclusively made  to enhance sounds, hence performs well while listening music, however gaming is not recommended for this pair, though mic and other features work well and build quality also up to the standards."
"Does the deal.. been using for a month now. The bass is good, while the sound quality is a little bit on the low side. If you are a music lover, definitely go for it! For listening to podcasts and yt, the sound quality is a bit disappointing. Hope they amp up the sound quality."
"They are the best of their price segment,  i have tried expensive brands too but even they were not that better. Sound quality is inexplicable! It's crisp and so optimised! You can have them on for hours and they just feel nice! From built quality to design everything is perfect."
size of the earphone head is bigger than i expected and so after a couple of hours of use my ear getting irritated and cause pain.Also the color is getting faded looking like a year old one.even within a couple of months.
It's not good than realme  but the build quality is good sound quality is average!If you are music lover aur movie lover then go for realme.
"excellent, go for it without any thought. this review is after using few months."
"audio quality is good and sound is very high. good performance with the earphones. basically i normally use headphones, so i am not aware of there ear phones. so i can't review more than this.but finally, i am satisfied with this product, if this earphones give any  trouble, then i will immediately update you.thank you"
"I liked the color of this earphone but if u like  listening songs sometimes on full volume there u feel a noise,,but according to price its ok and about bass i would say its not that good also sound of music comes out of the buds"
It is very good to hang in the ear my old earphones falls out from ear but these are way too good definitely recommended to buy.And it got total 3 set of plugs of different sizes so that we could adjust. Just go buy it
"I have been using these from a year and they are working just perfect though the earbuds create a problem the earbuds are loose and sometimes just tipped off from where they should be. Overall nice and good earphones that last. Also, Boat has amazing aftersale service so go on."
The sound gets squeaky. Makes noise on the other side of the network when you are on a call. Had replaced within the replacement period due to squeaky music but it seems the device version itself is as such.
"It's a very good product and that too with this low price. I also own samsung buds plus and it can be compared to it .So just imagine how the quality would be, it is very good quality so if you are searching for earphone in this price range it will be a good purchase"
"It looks so elegant. Bass quality is ok, sound quality is  so good, but noise cancellation is not so satisfying."
"This is 5th month of using this earphones now left side volume has become low and right is normal, this means in upcoming days left side is going to stop completely.Don't use such products"
"The sound quality of this earphone is quite average, though Base is good. The earphone is quite uncomfortable to wear honestly. It pains my whole ear."
"Product is in warranty.........have an issue that the earphones are increasing, decreasing,play/pause the sounds itself......and i am not getting any positive direction to resolve this issue"
Bass or treble ek dum mast hai... Bass kam nahi ho rahi treble ki vajha se.. Or treble balance hai.. Ek ek. Beat ache se sunti hai... I love it... Go for it..❤️
"It's nice product by boatAs boat is the brand in electronicBut 1 issue I saw this earphoneIs the mic , I mean it's good but sometimes during call other person complain about voice problemsOtherwise it's amazing product"
Nice product. At this price it's a good purchase. An average sound quality but good noise cancellation.
Lasted for 5 months and now reduces the volume on its own .Till it lasted it was awesome
"The earphones are very very nice. Sound quality is amazing as well as bass quality. I have order green and white one, it came as neon green. So check the color before you order. Beside the color the earphones are awesome. Loved it. Go for it."
Bad product don't buy because I bought only 2 months but now it's not working then warrenty is also iam not getting they will not respond  our call making fool of us plss don't buy
At this price range they best in terms of sound mic quality... Superb product uaing it for 2 years now
It has a good bass of sounds and comfort to wear. Music is good to listen. But call is really disappointed. The person who hear us can hear echo and disturbed noise. Eveyone ask while calling that you are travelling or not.
I'll add 4 out of 5 .It's nice but the ear buds can cause you pain for the first time overall it has good bass and sound quality also good
Product is good. Build Quality is good too. But BASS is poor compared to other wired earphones I have.
The sound quality is good and also comes with an additional min bag but the problem is my product is damaged.
"The sound quality is very good and much louder than any earphone I have ever used, noise cancellation is not much impressive but bass is better, and within this price range it's much satisfactory because it also has a warranty for one year. Overall rating from me is 4.9"
"Within 1.5 months it started malfunctioning. Some kind of problems like it will suddenly change the video or music, or it will get paused, or it will change the volume unnecessarily without my consent. And while in a call it automatically hold the call."
For this price this product is the winner.. The earphones would easily race down Even a 200 rs higher earphones.. The bass quality is up to standard.. The music quality can be said as crisp for the price.. Not much of noise cancellation.
The ear buds does not fit the ear even if the rubber pads are changed.Sound quality is ok types not very great.
"I used a lot of earphones and this one really impressed me.It fits good, sounds good, and I think it is the best wired earphone from Boat."
"Only in 10 days the earphone buttons not working property,automatically voice button work ,call disconnect, and  sometimes on call voice not coming,, ..How to replace my earphone . I register the complain.but koi bhi response nhi aaya .. Plz suggest amazon to get exchange faulty earphone"
Overall good product...  Not used much yet... Will write again review after few weeks of usage...
"Every thing is good but build quality is not good, I'll use feviquick to many times 😅😅, lower wire quality is good but in upper wire quality is not to good😅, overall too aacha h😍🥰 i love this earphones🥰🥰"
This headphone 🎧  is the best one .Awesome 👌  sound quality.Best noise cancellation .Super bass .
Mic is not working and I have replaced this headset several times but still they are giving this headset having mic problems apart from that sound quality and make are good but mic is important and that's not upto the mark totally waste for money without mic
Merits-Good lookingPerfect sound1yr warrantyPerfect for gym and sportsCost effectiveDemerits-Wire is thinNo L shape connectorBody is weak
The sound quality in this headset is far better than its peers in this category. It also fits properly in your ears and gives a passive noise cancelling effect due to the fit.
"I ordere this product just because of control buttons ,but control buttons not working. Three times I exchange them but every time they send wrong or defective product...."
"Good Midrange In-Ear earphones,The Grip is GoodSound Quality is AwesomeBass and Volume is Nice and HeavyLacks the Metal Feel as it is made up of Plastic entirelyCable Length is very longSweat and Water ResistantAlso 10MM driver makes it worth buying compare to other costly Wireless or Truely Wireless Earphones"
The earbuds are made pf plastic and there is no protection for wire connecting earbuds the wires are breaking from that part its only been 5 months since i bought this look for other earphones with breaded cable and L shaped jack in this price segment
"I got these today, as far as the quality is concerned, didn't find any flaw as such. Worked well, it's noice cancellation actually worked, uh hardly hear any external noice, uh barely hear if u put them on even if u not listening music.Also, I loved the cute tiny pouch they gave along with headphones they r sooper cute💕"
Microphone not working after use of one day....built quality is good.....sound just ok....highs are too high and lows are only it fit your ear nicely
"Its just ok,,Don't expect more from this headphone,I m prety much exited but after using i advice please check other option on this renge,Headphone Right sound much louder and Left sound only for minimum sound ...I m terrific about this, why this kind of happen ? Don't know...."
"You can never use as calling option, just useless af for calling.. There's no bass, just high volume which irritates you after sometime"
"This one’s perfect. Sounds premium, durable cable, perfect fit and water resistant. I use it in the gym and have no complaints except one: Don’t even try to turn up the volume above 75%. That’s the only drawback. But hey, go for it."
Best deal and value for money. Even they have exchanged it with a new one when I came across a little issue with it. Love you amazon services and thanks for your early prompt response.
I am reviewing after one month use.Good sound quality.Ear Comfortable.Play & pause⏸️ and call attend button work properly.Cable is too flexible.Noise cancellation ✅All over experience 👍👌I suggest you to buy this product.
"I want to give this product to  my all family member . It's sound quality very nice , I'm so glad to buy this product . It's brand ""BOAT"" not local . So I say to everyone to buy this product & happy with this"
It was good when it was new but after couple of months whenever I tweak the cordEither volume would change or it gets paused. So annoying. That controller became useless.
First few days working fine and it is not proper fixing on ear and feel pain and frequently removing buds from ear and skin out and don't refer this on your friends circle  . So much irrationally feel.so much noise. Don't refer any one this product.
Sound quality is awesomeIf you bass lover than don't buy it because bass is normal not very high.Noise cancellation not very impressive.But earphone quality very good and if you want for regular use pls don't worry and go for it.
bought it for making calls. but the mic is not up to the mark. opposite person cannot hear me clearly. and there is no return option...only 'replace with exact same item' possible. feel cheated.
"It's an awesome earphone at this price range.I bought it for 548rs but now it's cheaper than this.The only think that is not good is it's eartips.Eartips are not up to the mark, everything thing else is awesome."
Sound is good in this price range but rubber quality is not good after using it for 2 weeks earbuds became lose and the rubber provided for comfort loosen up after some time.
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
 No active noise cancellation but I really like the volume buttons. Fits perfectly to the ears with the supporting rubber thingy it has.
Cheap and best. Quality is good. Sound is good. But ear will pain till you get used to it. Bass is tremendous
It's a average earphone. Sound is clear. Bass not that much. Boat 225 is excellent. Choose 225 if love bass. Only positive aspect is that it doesn't fall from your ears. Snugs your ears well. Boat 225 is poor in that aspect. But I'll choose 225 over this.
Product is looks nice. Can't hear above 80% of the volume. Base is heavy and sound like a local earphones. I ordered carbon black which shown in Amazon website but received item little different. Overall ok to purchase not superb.
Active Black colour wire is only tangle free. I have purchased yellow colour which is not tangle free and wire broked in many parts  within 1 month. Only black coloured have plastic coated on wire and I am using this for more than three months.
At very starting it is just awesome...sound quality is good....but the main fact is that it didn't even last for a year...suddenly one day one side of the earphone stoped working...n after few days the other side....n now the whole thing messed up...(i tried it on several phones but it was not even detected by any one)
"Though the sound and noise cancellation is excellent, yet the earphones have the shortest life. Within 3 months the mic stopped working and volume changed itself. Going to the service centre is another big pain in the ass. Not worth the hassle."
"Worst one. Ears are paining a lot, less sound and no bass. While on the call, it creates some noise in the background and other person feels we are saying something. Dont waste your money on this as this has no return. I wasted my money and amazon cheated me without returning it"
You will not enjoy if you are sensitive to your ears plugin and music preferences. This is basic model for rough use. Not recommended for music lovers
•Superior Sound Quality•Secure Ear Fit•Comfortable•Great Build Quality•Tanglefree Wire•Perfect Bass And Balanced Treble•Decent Noise Cancellation•Ideal Net WeightI wouldn't even mind paying ₹1200 for such an amazing product!
"I bought this product 6 months before quality is good and sound is ok, after 6th month one of the ear piece didn't work then I applied for warranty I received replacement product as new , I tried all brands ( Skullcandy, Phillips ,etc ) for warranty but it did not end well,  I really appreciate  what they are doing and I highly recommend to buy these."
The product is worst....Not worth the money.It is same as 50rs earphone will get on Streets.That is my experience..or dont know amazon tries to sell the crap ones first and give the good ones after replacement...but worst experience with these earphones
Its not working 1 sideIts a good earphones and i want to replace my earphones but thier is no option to replace
Product seemed best for FIRST FEW MONTHS ONLY  ! After using roughly it gradually wears and tears and slowly parts of the earphone gets start loosening and disintegrating . The rubber gets romoved and lost it ; and finally it broke into two peices one fine day and stopped working .ONLY ATTER FEW MONTHS OF USE AM REVIEWING IT !
I have brought it before 6 months. It is not working on both sides. Base is not equivalent. One side is not working. In my experience I want to tell some thing that don't buy cheaper products that will damage with in 6 or 9 months. Think about it.
The quality of product ia excellent tha cable is coted with transparent ruber and sound is excellent but the problem is you can listen music at full volume its very loud and bass is less at high end in med end its awesome but it lacks at high end
Good work boat team ! Nice bass good sound quality and awesome experience!All my friend buy boat earphone Bina koi confusen ke Jo aap ish money lahaoge aap ko ye usse Jada Kush Kar dega.Aur ayi karunga aap ishe jarur buy kareBye bye
"Wire quality & buttons are not good, that's why i doesn't long much but you don't worry about it just claim your warranty on boat.lifestyle website , good fitting in ears due to hook. Overall nice product in ₹400"
"I think this is the best earphones in this price range. It also comes with a carrying pouch and the looks are amazing. The quality of wire is also very good. Also the fit is also very sturdy and u can use it in the gym also. Its very light weight and u can wear it all day long. Overall according to me, u can buy this product anyday."
Very bas after sales serviceCan't blame service center even company is much more bad not willing to give after sales service and they first won't pick if pick will be on line for an hour and when they connect gives false promises
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
" Your product best sound best quality but left side not working from today my return policy finish .Canon, you understand that a site is running, a site is not running, please give someone an earphone or a product like this."
"Please don't go as per the reviews. The sound quality is pretty bad. I was surprised to see so many good reviews for a bad product.Got it for 550 INR, the actual cost should be around 300 INR only.Not a great product."
This should not say bass in its name as there is no bass at all..it is just ok to watch movies on laptop or phone for audio clarity..for music it's useless..only very high pitched treble..
I have purchase boAt Bassheads 242 on 17 january 2021 and this Bassheads were not working properly after 4 months  only . I have complant for the product  20 Apirl 2021 and they have taken my product  and not givrn my refund money so kindly refund my money backThank youKanika Masta
Product is really better than others products and super fast delivery by amazon. and really feel good bass and notice cancellation freature is also working very good. Overall product performance is beyond my expectations.
"Perfect in every way, the precision, quality and material all are superb.. Go for it"
"With the price range the are in, it is a good product. You would want to hear upto 70% volume. using at 100%, this will surely damage your hearing. Bass is good beyond 60%. comes with different sizes of ear tips."
"I always use boat earphones, neckband and airdopes but this time am having the worst experience with the wired bassheads 242. Right side stoped working within 20 days and the left side stopped within a month.... worst experience ever."
I have to compromise with cable quality.Sound is good but bass is little high in the earphone. In line volume button makes it extra ordinary from other earphones. But the quality of earbuds is low and made up of plastic.
"Using it for 3 months now, the sound quality is pretty decent. but today it was in my jeans pocket and went inside the washing machine and survived a full 1 hour wash. impeccable waterproofing I must say it's surprisingly still working properly and the sound is still spot on"
We can use this only for call purpose and to watch movies. It's not okay for music lover. Bass is not much effected. It's upto the given money. Worth buying for ₹400
Headphone Wires are not enough thick to make it rough and tougth. I suggest to go for  boAt BassHeads 225 in-Ear Wired Earphones
The earphones aux is hard to remove once connected with mobile due to it's shape. Noise cancelling not good. Bass is Ok. Soung quality is also ok. But the design and build quality is bad
"I suggest this one to the bass lovers... Also let me add, don't expect a greater experience, but it's a lovely one.. A good and decent for the price.. It's worth for that range.. loved it."
"This Is amazing 😍👍 in this Prize, A1 colur , and build quality is awesome and one important thing that is they give us a boat small bag to carry the this earphone.. #Specially thnkx to Boat and Also Amazon."
"So bad quality, i purchased before 13 days,now one side (left side) specker not work,so my advice is,,so much bad quality earphones"
Everything is GREAT.....Good Packaging ❤️🙏🏻 and outstanding sound quality ...with high performance bass....loved it really ...my trusted brand love you....and before the Boat Basshead 242 i was using Boat 225....Both are really amazing......love you BOAT ❤️♥️🥰♥️🥰🥰❤️❤️
"This is my first time,using a Boat Earphone and this particular model Boat 242 is BEST in its Segment(Below 500rs).Build Quality is Above average,and worth for the price.I've never tried any Boat Product before,using these earphones make me think upon them.Impressive!."
Earphone is good initially but after 4 months I will vibrating the wire to increase the volume and sometimes i will become very irritate bcoz my class is going but no soung from my earphone i this was same like 100 wali earphone
The sound quality is very good  but the only problem is the mic stopped working within 2 months the built quality of the wire is weak it got  repaired within 4 months ..so I'm rating just 3stars 😑
At this price sound is not that good. Even 300rs handsfree from local marker gives mesmerizing sound. And when it delivered to me its one side earphone stopped working. Volume button when used for increasing sound it reduces sound. No value for money.
It's the best in ear than bassheads 200Cause its bass is very punchy that your ear will explodeBut this 242 is very good please buy itIt worth the costI purchased it 6 and I get yesterdayAnd watched a series the boysIt was awesome
Boat service center is useless... .. and online replacement time more than 15 days ..... So boat product warranty claim is not easy.... And I will not purchase any product of boat....
"Audio quality is good. It has a extra two sets of ear buds(small, medium). One earphone pouch which is small. Ear s getting pain after 20mins of usage because of ear buds."
i just used 2 months one side earphone stopped work don't cheat customers really i had worst experience in amazon
"Always boat is my first choice..Best in the market.. Good productsSince I'm using boat from my previous purchase, no doubt it's is the great choice in budget.Bass consistency is always good.. Though design is quite, inappropriate overall u can buy it.. Worth for money."
"Probably the first time, a Boat product is found very bad...The ear pieces are very bad that they start paining your ears hard. Primarily for this reason, I would not recommend this product. Sound quality is also average."
when i use it  for calling then call Reciever detected A annoying sound.. I also tried for more calling  but sam annoying sound found ..Hope you understand my problem and solve This problemThanks Boat And Amazon...
"Light weight,Perfect fitting in the ear, not painnig in the ear.Bass is awesome but not compare to realme budds 2.Feeling like a sporty look,And most i like it's come with a volume +/- and call receive/end buttons. Most of the earphones had not this button in this price range.this is the very important feature and plus point of boat basshead 242."
It has very good sound quality and excellent noise cancellation. Can be used for long hours without and discomfort. Those ear hooks ensures that headset stays in the ear even while running. But bass quality could have been better for the price range of this product.
"This product is very good. No noise, Good Base and music. Perfectly working with Equalizer variations. Model is good. Can insert in air perfectly. An original product from Boat"
"The product has stopped working , in just 10 days . It's useless product waste of money."
Uncomfortable n sounds not that great even.They buying something else in same price
Hi i am writing this review after use of almost 3months.. The quality is poor hence within the warranty period the I started facing issue with product... Not recommend.. Big brand but poor quality product.  Feel like cheated :-(
"Immediately after 2 3 months of usage gets damaged and starts behaving on its own like volume gets increased /decreased /muted , disconnected from call all on its own without any command from user. Not fit for rough use."
Sabse bekar earphone hai yeh aaj tak mei jitne bhi earphone use kiya hun unme se  bekar hai yeh ek toh iska paint hat jayega 1 week mei hi or dusra yeh earphone connect hone band kar deti 1 mahine baad se hi agar meri mano toh 549 mei koi aur earphone lo yeh mat lena
"Boat's quality of built for this series is beyond poor, left side went from low sound to completely bust in just under 2 months period, no warranty or repair possibility too. Hope someone in Boat is paying attention."
Boat is delivering good quality products in best prices. Amazing sound quality and durability of these earphones make this product value for money and best seller 🙂
Product is very goodColor is very attractive and quality of sound and wire is also very flexible and variantLight in weightCan be use for longer hours
Nice product.... Only two issues. One that it was best if I could get a pouch to keep it in proper manner. And other is earplug are slightly hard.
Very good product. Fits in the ear comfortably. Stretch resistant.
"These stopped working the next day I bought, I bought 3 of them because I previously loved this earphone and so thought of buying it for the whole family, but they ripped us off. the next day I tried refunding it, but they never respond after faking to return it.i am never buying anything from Amazon again"
"When u play game, your teammates can hear ecos, for everything in the game which is extremely irritating and left and right sound cant Be heard properly, worst gaming earphones to buy dont buy if u want to play games with it!"
Best product so far at this price. It’s durable and good for regular use
I experienced this using in different different applications but no bass receives as expected even though written over the box and in advertising …….you can just use for phone calling
"The ear phone is sturdy and cute looking. Fits year fine. But the sound quality needs improvement. For the amount being charged, there are better products available. Noise cancellation is ok."
"Every other month we are ordering head phones, shall look for more lasting brand.... will not recommend BOAT"
Unnecessarily heavy bass like all other boat products. Slightly uncomfortable to wear. But satisfactory for the price
"Although it does not supported for my phone, i have them for another phone and guess what BOAT BASS ARE Always lit."
"Under rs 500 , this product is a beast 😍😍😍😍 the sound quality is good , noice cancellation in good i can’t even hear anything even when they say something lol😂 and the bass is superb😍😍😍 and the colour of this colour is really beautiful 😍"
it is very good and feels very comfy although the noise cancellation is passive and not that good the rest of he experience is great
I will not say that this is awesome and excellent.  But this is quite nice decent earphone and this price range.  Audio quality is very good and the mic is very good too.  We are using it for track singing.. though its our time pass passion.
The quality and sound is good. I listen at mininum volume but it is still very audible. I am happy with the product overall.
This product is basically for those who love to hear more bass sound quality.**** Perfect for online classes.**** perfect for songs.But not for long time use product (2-3hrs) after ears feels the pain....... OVERALL PRODUCT IS BEST 💯💯💯💯
"After 20 days use , Now the voice is not clear.I think this is defective piece.But replacement policy is of only 7 days.So I can't replace this now."
Good sound earphones but Lasted for just 2months then left side stopped working very disappointed
Almost equal in sound quality to realme buds 2 NeoMic is a little down than realme buds 2 Neobass is little better than realme buds 2 Neo
"Liked: Sound output with great Bass, wire quality..Doubt: life of the product..."
Although sound is great but they provide cheap parts like the filter paper it has is so easily to rip off . So the one headphone is sounds like so bad without that. You have to take care of these so much
"This is the best product at this range (Rs.500). The sound quality is mesmerizing and the earpiece is perfectly fit into the ears without falling while in motion. So, I can suggest you guys can buy this product without hesitation. You won't regret 🤙🏻"
This is very good for music but on call some time your voice will not reach proper
"There is no bass quality and the quality of the sound is 'screechy', awful and horrible. Not worth even if I'm given the money to take it. Amazon should take it off their list. Wonder how could they even include it for sale!"
"Everything is good, one thing that could have better if the holding clip was little bit bigger so that it could hold entire wire of earphone. That's all, other then that it's awesome product."
"Sound quality, colour and headset quality is good but sometimes I feel the earbuds doesn't fit well and ear paining after some time.Cannot use this continuously. Really disappointed."
The sound quality is very balanced. You can the vocals clearly. Perfect for music lovers.The earphones fit perfectly on your ears and doesn't come out easily. Built quality is decent enough. And its also water resistant.
quality of earphones r good but in 15 days one earphone sound was not coming .n no replacement as no service centre in near our place dombivli .have to go to thane or vashi for replacement .
This product is not value for money above 500 because ....1.sound quality is not good as much I accepted2.it give high bass to sound and sound not come clearly3.best for only low users4.quality of product is good
Must buy if you are looking for wire earphones and buy the best of the bass. Boat has it..
"product quality is not good as expected ,no voice is coming while listening the music.when I tried to return it back there is no return option you will get only replacement option.don't waste your money."
"good product with nice sound quality, the only thing is that you have keep it putting in right way"
Build Quality is below standard. Within 2 weeks audio pin gets bended and not usable now.Would not recommend.
The product is very good. But the wires a bit thin that doesn't matter a lot. And I thing I would like to tell that when you see it for first time it would not look that damn good but as you use for some more time you will simply love it. And I am loving it too...💙
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
 Like reason - Boat brand and good quality of sound.Dislike reason- Not comfortable on ear
"As it's name suggests,  it's a basshead and damn nice .Good sound qualityBest bass and baseExcellent purchase.Love it"
The only minus point ..it captures backgrounf noise too much..
"Worst product of boat,never purchase this product, in video calling ,the other person hear voice twice. I have tested in 3-4 product, UT result remains same. Sound quality, noise cancelation and base quality, every thing is worst."
Liked feature is its sound clarity and bassDisliked feature is its product build. Only one month used and its left side speaker was dead
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
 The packaging was bad and it was not sealed.  Since product was working and was in urgent requirement. Did not returned.
"After usage of 1 month, the microphone stopped working. The person on the other side cant hear you. Service centres are very few in Mumbai and there is no pickup facility provided by the company. Very disappointed!!"
If you thinking to buy earphones around 500 u can go with this.Bass is superQuality is goodOver all sound quality is clear and loud
Good one and happy to bought it. Safety coating in wire and it will increase life of the product
"Price to performance wise is good But you want best of the best go another boat or other brand 💀 , snizer, etc"
"I do not understand why this product has got a 4 rating. Don't get carried away by the looks and the brand. The sound quality is worst. Even if you play 8d music, worst experience. You will not be able to enjoy the real music."
"Pros:1)  Sound is nice2)  Passive Noise Cancellation is best at this price.3)  Fitting in ear is superb!!4)  Braded Cable, so long lastingCons:1)  As of now, I can't see any cons."
I brought it for 500 and it is awesome nd worthy. Sound quality is gud and base is also gud. U can go for it.The thing is u have to use ur earbud in right position otherwise u will suffer some pain because of earbud support.
"After the smartphone, headphones are the gadget we reach for most often in our daily lives. Here's a perfect pair of headphones out there for everyone, and it's just awesome.Very good crystal clear voice. Complete noise cancelling. Lovely bass. Perfect design that suits perfectly in ears. I  M  LOVING IT."
"Worst products never buy this right side earphone stopped working right after 2days use and o didn't expect such worst quality , don't buy boat products  worst of worst"
నాకు చాలా బాగా నచ్చి౦ది కలర్Bass Sound Superb !!!Sound Clarity Amazing
"Value for money.. Sound Quality is Crystal clear with amazing Bass.. Noise Cancellation is great.. Worth the buy.. Its been just a few days for me.. It fits the ear perfectly, doesn't da or come off easily.. can easily be used to outdoor activities, gym and running.. 😊"
It stopped working in 3 months but I complain to boat within a week they sent me a new one best customer service and I have fallen in love with this earphone❤
"Quality is not good. No bass at all. Thanks to Amazon, returned. This is a waste product. I bought boat Bluetooth earphones which are very good. But this is utterly disappointing."
Wow it's really amazing design I bought it for 400rupees in prime offer play pubg with HD sound is very interesting don't compare with other headsets durability is good
That's what a earbud is... Blown the mid away...... You can't except such a diamond in such price its bass is better than any brand or JBL also.... sound clearity is excellent in the price. And appearence and built quality is outstandingAt last i recommend this earphone
The left and right sound is very badPhone has to be restarted to fix 3d sound errorIt reverses its 3d sound when playing pubg or any other 3d sound-playable things..Bass quality is goodNoise cancellation is goodSound quality is good
"It's very nice product because it provides super noise cancellation and sound quality and it's very good looking and stylish and attractive and reasonable price and I recommend this product to buy and it also provides accessories like clip,bag,sticker,user manual,posters etc"
"Good build, good sound quality. However, if you have used premium headphones before, then you won't enjoy this one. But anyway, satisfactory product at this price range."
"Earphone sound quality is good but the Bass is over pumped, 70% volume is Good for this Earphone but in high Volume the bass is too high it will reduced the clarity of Mids and Highs."
I think the product are good and discount Givin by Amazon made it superb.. I get it only 399 and also get cashback..
The  boat base heads is giving problem in one of the channel it gives disturbance  can you do any service for it since I have one year warrenty
After 4 days automatically volume getting increase and decrease.
Bhaishab...killer voice heavy bass.. I'm using this only on 1 note on my mobile..Everyone must buy this... thanks Boat for this...
"If you want a reliable headphone that lasts a long time then this is it, I don't know much about sound quality but it's I can able to hear sound clearly and good to use in meetings and movies and general stuff."
Sound quality and bass is great at this price and the noise cancelling could be better.Best thing is the build quality. The cable are tangle free and not so heavy as compared to bassheads 255
"I had ordered this product by seeing good reviews but unfortunately, after delivey, I tried using earphones for my mobile realme 2 pro which has a 3.5mm jack for which it is not supporting.  Even the volume and Play/Pause not working."
"This earphone has best sound quality. The bass is too good. In many earphones, the Bass supresses the voice but in this, clear vocals are heard with a great bass and surround sound effect is also awesome. Highly Recommended. 🎉 🎉"
It's very amazing earphones. I am fully satisfied with it. Must buy. After buying my earphones I have bought also for my fiance.Full bassNoise cancellation perfectSound quality very good.I suggest you all to buy this earphones. Money worth.
I purchased 2 set of earphones one red and another black these two colours are sporty and looks premium but it depends on your taste and the features are much good and noise cancellation is good bass is fantastic and sound is best so you can buy it
"Comfort level is good , good fit , price is little bit of high, not Good for song listening. Otherwise it is very good."

 great bass and quality no no for noise cancellation other than that the color is pretty powerful if you know what i meannn buddy
Useful component of the smart phone which can be used without discomfort
Tbvh at first i was really scared to buy them. You see you can't trust anyone so easily. So my thought at once were like will they work or not after the package is deliver but I gotta say well done Amazon. The earphones and it's reviews were up to the mark. The sound quality and the bass is perfectly perfect. Cheers to my choice 😳.
"I never wrote any review for any product but this product encourage me to write.What a amazing product it is. Super, clear and beautiful sound and design. It is good in all aspects. Thank you boat thank you Amazon."
Good at this price but the ears really hurt ofbyou use it. I generally use it for office meetings and after meal walks. Not a prolonged user hence ok for me.
Sound quality:- 4/5Noise cancellation:-1/5Bass quality:-3/5Overall noise cancellation is soo bad😡😡😡. That's it effect too much too ur hearing......! Really disappointed with Boult😡😡😡.
"Best earphones in this price range...i recommend anyone to buy this and will not regret it. Awesome bass, Noise isolation is there but don't hope too much, if you listen in full volume, then it will not really matter. Good Microphone"
"Good, but not as expected. It's strain/pain on Ears. Voice is clear but lacks bass."

 Good for music and attend online classes.Base: goodNice cancellation: very goodMic: very goodI bought it in 399 rupees.
"Product was fine at some aspects... Sound was good..But sometimes it's makes some distortion like old product., specially when connected end side with phone. Overall product was good and price was good.But product is not fully tested I think."
There is no grip at the jack so it's so hard to remove it from mobile evertime it's sleep when try to pull.It's so cheap in bass part u can barely catch bass even at full volume in party songs not worthfull. I tried for 5 days.
"The sound quality Is great, and specially recommended for bass lovers and sport freaks. The wire's built quality is good but not tangle free If you are a bass lover then go for it but listening for more than 2 hours gives pain due to high effective music quality..."
"First of all the pause play button doesn't work properly sometimes it does sometimes it doesnt, and secondly u cant change songs with volume button and thirdly it stopped working in just 3 months"
"Good sound quality and different ear size plugs with ear clipAfter one year am editing, it lasted for one year only"
Sound clarity goodStylishVery lite weightButFirst time ordered one i am facing issue in volume control button not workingReturned and get new one but again facing the same issueIs this manufacturing defect ?Please respond
One speaker is cracked in 12 days
Sound quality is very good.Noise cancellation is very good.Bass quality is good.Overall product is good at this rate.Plus it comes with a cute little pouch 😂💙I am satisfied
Jack of the earphone having smooth metallic surface due to which it slip sometimes while ejecting it.Ears pain by wearing for more than 1hr.I feel no use of clip given.It is very difficult to insert earphone inside the pouch bag given.
The headphone wire was so delegate that 2 or 3rd day of use the wires was cut into 2 pieces.I have used boat before was good but this one is the worst which I have every used.0 rating if possible
Very comfortable ears phones. They do cancel the noise to a level. But obviously it's not active noise cancellation. Value for money if you're looking for budget earphones.
I bought this earphone 15 days back and now its mic and buttons have stopped working. A very bad experience from a company like Boat. Disappointed
One side of my earphones is not working.
"These are very good earphones in terms of sound and build quality, but they are not the most comfortable. After using for more than 30 mins they cause a lot of pain in my ear and get uncomfortable. I suggest everyone to go with the rounded earphones instead."
The sound quality is not as expected.The design looks premium but it's not same with the sound.sound is very loud and the music gets distorted at high volumesIf your priority is a good looking and well designed earphones go for it.It has best fit in the ears.
1.Good sound quality2.Volume and pause buttons3.best direct on the spot replacing product services.4.working nicely even after treated harshly5.The one and only best earphone under Rs.399 on offers deal.
Good sound quality. Does not fall off the ear. Only thing would want is wire that does not tangle.
Spend 100 more and get Realme buds 2.I purchased it thinking it would be better than basshead 220 but the bass is way lower than optimal and has very high treble. Tried to balance things by Equalizer still nothing helped.Don't buy to waste your money.
I have been used this product last 3 months ..its totally wow the quality of sound is also good and bass is also good ...if u r going to purchase some earphone in future then definitely u have to go for this superb product..I love it 😘😘😘
Product is not good at all this headphone would not servive one month... Are you kidding in just 15 days 1st left side was not working and then then whole headphone is not working in just 25 days...i raise a ticket for return but till now no response nice boat team appreciated
Not working properly and sound is not properly coming in one side..not good quality...not properly fits and uncomfortable in ear....provides minor electric shock to ear sometimes....not recommended
Called bassheads but.. Average.. And wire quality is like cheap materials.. I purchased for online classes.. N some music.. But not meet that on paper said quality.. அந்த அளவுக்கு நல்ல இல்ல in

 U can't listen them on full volume 😂 they are just ovr ..might destroy ur ears.....but in little low vol. they are good in this price.
"The bass, the overall sound is amazing if youre gonna use it for home or personal use and the mic is also amazing!!!!!!Packaging-5/5...PLS DONT GO BY THE BAD REVIEWS AND YOURE GONNA HAVE AN AMAZING PRODUCT ON YOUR EARS!"
"Lasted only 3 months, customer service is non existent in certain states and inaccessible in states (only state capital)No email nor toll free no. response from the company customer support."
"sound quality is awesome , wire quality is excellent , look wise awesome , only bass is slightly less than expected .....,if you want for only music purpose can have many high bass earphones , otherwise very descent product .."
"Well it is amazing product and after using for 6 months, this is still in best shape, sound quality and colours.Best buy"
"Worst Head phone...I have Wasted  my hard earned Rs.500/ on this use less headphone.I advise to every one ,Never Ever Purchase this headphone.If there would have be negative star ,I would have given 5 negative star."
"It was delivered to me on 7th dec 2019 and since then, it has been 3 months using them. I can conclude that i can take a bath wearing these altough i would not recommend it to you guys. Every thing is great about these except the secure fit ear hooks they are uncomfortable, that is why i don't use them. Totally  worth it and it also comes with an one year warranty."
For 10mm sized driver the performance is luke warm. My 12mm boult sound way way better and cost almost half.
Achi quality h. Sound bhi achaGaming and music dono k liye best h is price pe. Sound 1 dam clear h game me aur music bhi clear h.All the best if you buying this❤
"The sound quality of this headphone is pretty good,and the vocal and instruments are good in this headphone and also the microphone is good noise cancellation is avarage,but the cable and jack quality is avarage not satisfied with them..."
"The product is not durable.It started malfunctioning after 6 days.If audio jack is slightly touched, audio starts cracking.You may avoid this product for sure."
Great bass and volume. Must buy cz it is as good as described. And great experience of buying on Amazon unlike FK it gives you great service.
"The sound quality is very good, although the bass is little overpowering. A great product. Fits well. Noise cancellation is good. The box inside had a small crack but it's fine. Overall liked the product."
"It comes with a carry pouch of good quality..I am already using boatairdopes 441 ,so i was expecting the sound quality like that...but it's somewhat lower..But if you look at the cost,it feels ok."
"The worst ear phone I ever used in terms of comfortablility. This has shorp edges, you feel pain in the ear, just few minutes after wearing it... Don't buy if you need a comfortable ear phone"
Boat earphone 242 is just extream bass and very good quality earphone in this market at this price range. guys must buy this...Just Awasome sound quality.😍👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻..Also Thanks to Amazon For Faster Delivery and Good Packaging 😇
Earlier when i opened the box i was shocked that i might get fake one bcoz of the gap btw earpiece housing and wire. Although good earphone nice sound and bass but i want more volume level when i listen to acoustic songs.good colour options and one of best under 500 range.
Go for it. Sound quality is good but treble is excess. Bass quality is good. I got it at 549 which us quite expensive. 400 is a good price for this product.
"Good enough for the money I paid, was able to use it for two years before I physically broke off one of the earpieces from the joint. The sound quality is decent and quite balanced, does not have heavy bass like some others"
I have using this product since 2 months and then giving my experience. Bass quality of this product is beyond expectation at this price range and also sound quality is amazing. Overall really amazing product.. loving this boat basshead 242
"Speechless, sound quality good, product quality good, cable and other parts are also good, I hv little problem with ear buds"
The bass of this lovely earphone is AMAZING. Highly recommended for EDM and Pop lovers. I am saying this after 1 month of use. The product is as good as it was on purchase...not even a scratch and note that I have it for almost 8 hrs everyday since it came to me. Should definitely go for it.
Cool product from Boat. Value for money. In this price can't expect anything more. Very good bass. Clear sound. Tangle free wire.
"Not working after a months use. Not recommended. Tried to activate the warranty, even the number provided to activate warranty is fake. Your warranty won't get activated. No point in buying this."
Absolutely good Product.Not Recommend for heavy Usage. Ear will get pain.
"One side box is littel  open,an othere side is seel, I have no saw like that, Amazon is my frovrite shopping hubBut if the quality is like this, then I have to change my choice"
Noise cancellation nahi hai aur jo bhi songs and call par jo baat karte hai wo bahar sunae dete hai.boat company disappointed me. plz work boat noise cancellation and follow promises with u r customer.
Performs well enough for the price range. Decent sound quality with pretty good noise cancellation owing to snug fit in the ear but the better feature is the mic and the volume control buttons
Sound quality is good but the cable quality is very very poor...if you improve cable quality than this product deserves 4 star.. 👍👍
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
 I have ordered 2 quantity and the product I received is too good. You should go for these earphones. Their sound quality is also the best. It's absolutely worth the price👍
I loved the product.  Clear sound.  Options to increase n decrease volume on side mic.. also able to control music.
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
" It's good for normal use like using for phn calls.the music voice is too sharp,it dpnds on prsn to prsn what kind of sounds they like but for me its too sharp n prickly."
"Awesome Sound n bass quality, one of it's kind. Worth buying thought it's just first day of usage. Delivery was really fast."
Worth for every penny. Lways prefer boat brand fot the headphones and earphones. They are having good sound engineers. Also this brand is comparitively low price
"Satisfied, value for money , stylish and comfort to ears"
"Great in ear experience. Almost as good as any other brand at this price. Music is balanced, distorts a little bit at highs. Definitely recommend for music, not for gaming."
"Sound clarity is not upto the mark if you go for sound level more than 70%, also not having good bass. I had bought at ₹399"
Good for daily normal use. Explore other options if sound quality is your requirement
I was fan of boat but this earphone when I but it is superb but some time the micro phone has stoped working but earphone is still working
Overall I would say it is good. But the features are a bit less vis a vis the price. But anyone can go for it and its working very fine.
Nice earphones. I am using them from last 2-3 months on laptop for office calls and they are performing very well. One of the best thing I liked about these headphones are they don't tangle. Highly recommended product.
"Most worst product ever I got from Amazon. Don't buy from this seller ever. I returned the item but still got defected. Its sound quality is decent but its mic is worst, even a Rs50 earphone is better than this."
Stopped working in 15 days & now I can’t even return it as return policy was 7 days return only.
Not worth for the price.Instead this earphones get Realme earphones.  It's best in class...
Sound quality is pretty average. But I think we can't expect more from this price range. The color on the jack started to come off within 2 months. They'd be really uncomfortable for people with small ears.
"Not comfortable in ears and if u try to listen music on bit high volume, the voice start busting (fatna ) , and the sound leaking problem too,  giving this review after using 3 months of usage."
Just amazing earphones... First of all wire is very strong and thick.. So it will be long lasting... The sound quality and bass are always good in boat earphones.. Just go for it...
It does a good job for noise cancellation and also has a very stable quality. It doesn't fall off my ears like the last one from boat. This is a decent and Great buy for this price.
This company never sees to amuse us. 500rs for a good product. Also they provide a year warranty which is cool.
Light weightMade of good materialBass quality is very goodIt has volume buttons which is very rare for earphones at this price11-5-2021Ear buds net is comming out.Generates lot's of heat in your ear.
"Absolutely fraud products by agents,my rigt earphone was not working within 2 months, to raise the complaint no invoice will be downloadable and no warranty card will be downloadable from amazon app, its a scam and no customer support will help you."
I had purchased this earphone due to its volume control buttons and pause Play button but it is not working with my MI5A device. I feel it is waste of money for me.
Cheap and best in quality as well as performance
Value for money.gr8 sound.quality good.super bass.clear .buy it without hasitation.go for it.i m not disappoint.
Value of the money. Best quality of sound. Pouch quality very good
"Best buy at 449 rs, i hv used jbl & Skullcandy but this one is worth buying when I compare noise cancellation, bass quality and overall sound and material builtup."
"Its okay. But if you need it for singing or recording purpose, than don't buy."
"Mmm nah, not good, not good at all, I'd say mediocre at best. Sound quality isn't HD it's average. It's durable though and has a good mic. Want good sound quality and mic ? You could spend a 100 more bucks and go for JBL, but that is a bit less durable than this one."
mic Stop working within a week. Very bad product and totally waste of money.
All over performance is ok...I thought these bassheads have more treble than bass...Fine build quality... inbuilt volume and play/pause key are plus points for convenient and faster checkouts
"During call it's automatically disconnected and speaking person can not heard my sound.Really i do not expect thia from boat & Amazon .I will never order this type of products from Amazon, Because Amazon compromised product quality, seller reputation.Where flipkart checked and assured."
"If you are willing to buy in 400-600 budget these are hood earphones with mic, if you are fond of just listening music(i mean no req. of mic) then go for Sennheiser Cx-180 i guess those are the best earphones.If you have higer budget then go for brainwavz or Sennheiser CX-275"
"Good sound quality , but some times we need to rotate or press the Jack to hear both side and some noise is coming in ideal time. And one side ear phone giving pain to ear .."
Overall product is good 4 star for product price and functionality.On paper boat is an Indian company there goods are from China . So not worth in purchasing boat products anymore. This will be last product from boat
Sound quality and everything else is really great but after a hour or more of usage ut just gets really uncomfortable this was my review at first usage now things have messed up even more like now i m getting bussing sound from one of them al the time. Just after 10 days of use can anyone help me get refund or soo
"Just good , because price range highIn rs 400 this earphone best"
I don't know about longitivity butLooks good and elegantFeels good with great noise cancellation and bassPerfectly fits my ear structure
After two months only one ear piece is working and another is not working. The sound is getting disconnected frequently when listening. NOW RETURN WINDOW IS CLOSED SO REFUND MY MONEY.
"Good quality headset at this price range.Got for 549/- in offer - Thanks to Amazon, quick Delivery... And packaging. Sound quality is good and clear.  Tested it on deep baas & trouble level.. Noise cancellation is also good.Just try with matching bud size..Wire is rugged and good.👍 worth buying it..."
Please don't buy this model if you workout outdoor...and if you sweat alot the mic will not work..... I have replaced it but the same problem occured again and now I can't use it for calling... It's a no go if you workout outdoor.. Or sweat lot.
Earphone sound is good but material quality is not..... Those red colour part on which boat symbol is thier came out within a week when took now I have sticked with glue now 🤦🏼‍♂️..Is there any chances for replacement or return ?
I purchased this product pn 12 aug it was working good but sound was good the after 3 month its starts making my mobile not working properly then after 2 week one side earphone get stopped then both stopped working today
What a clear and crisp sound. Will enjoy every bit of sound. Feel like a headphones of around Rs 5000 but in this low price.  But one thing I don't like is the plastic ear adjuster. That's does not fit properly and you have to push repeatedly
"I'm a producer and I don't use any fancy headphones but these thing gets my job done and I'm totally satisfied by its sound quality ... Four stars coz after a year , the left channel isn't working ... Its fine though enough for a 500 Rupees earphone ... Go for it ..."
I have been using this eardphone for the past six months and i am very much impressed by the sound quality of the earphone. The bass is amazing and based on my past experiences it is pretty durable too.
The sound quality is good but when using for long hours ears are paining .
Its is a good quality earphone in this price range it comes with 1 year warranty
"Pretty good according to it's price. Quality is good, bass is also good compared to other productsAll over it's a decent product to go for!"
"It is the best product but Mice is not ever best . I purchased it before 5 month ago and it's mice have worsted. It has 1 year warranty but I can't see any option at there to replace it , that's why don't buy it."
"Worst quality, there is not even return for this item. I don't want this product buy stuck with it now. Amazon is not even providing solution for return... Money waste please don't buy."
Sound quality is great but doesn't last long.
Like it and using for meetings and listening music
"I jus love this headphone, having good surround sound, and noise cancelling...but the bass is not satisfied... MI basic model earphones were very good in bass ... though  it  is a very good product for its rate ..."
According to price Built Quality is excellent.. Sound quality is ok but not that great... Bass quality is very disappointing.Noise cancellation is also not that great.. but a good product considering this price.
"Yes, this is a budget piece, and understandable that all the features will be mediocre.I personally found the sporty design in this particular earphone to be a bit uncomfortable after few hours [say 1-1 1/2 Hours], yet manageable.Overall a good product for the price range. !"
"Sound quality is good not the best.. Wire quality is bad. Most important material of the earbud is very bad, not soft silicon buds these feels plastic and uncomfortable."
I am using this product from last 4 days not satisfied with product. Poor sound and not fit in ears.If your budget is less then prefer otherwise go for good one.not at all happy.
Good for musicNot suitable for callingOften i got complaint that My voice echoes to other side of liseners.
Is my first experience with Boat...  sound quality is cool bass quality also quite good.. if u confused about ur headset plz go for this..it's amazing ...
Worstproduct after 3 months it was not working and build quality is worst it is so much bad its case is also not so good boat bassheads 228 is best it is not a upgraded version of 228.... Wastage of money
Worth single penny. Great sound quality. Perfect for calls and listening music. Product quality is pretty good and fits perfectly in ear.
Excellent sound and build quality. Very crisp and distortion free sound. But is a bit too loud. And prolonged use will hurt the ears. Still worth the money.
Lift earpiece is not working damaged. It's the second time that i have received a Deffective one. First time i just ignored it asked for replacement but now. I am giving a suggestion not to buy this to everyone.

 Bhot Badiya Erphone Hai Sounds Bass bhi Tik h Calling bhi bhot Achi h Gaming ke liye bhi bhot badiya h Pubg khelne m bhi bhot Acha Lagta h Sab kuch Badiya h Erphone m
Could have given 5 stars however just because it doesnt fits my ears very accurately gave 4. Otherwise absolutely fantastic
earphone is ok i have used it if uh have a liitle but high budget thi go for jbl100si best earphone for anything no one can match the level of jbl i have. used  225 boats 242 220 every but the sound quality like jbl i have not get in any of the boat product
"Its been almost 6 months I am using these headphones, sound quality is very good. No  complaints. Noise cancelation. Simply value of money."
Ear phones are very uncomfortable to use. They slips out and causing pain in the ears. Also the wire tangles makes it messy
"Very much comfortable 😀 and you can use while sleeping too 😉 and it doesn't come out untill you remove it , powerful bass , worth for the money 449+40 delivery charge and its water proof and sweat proof , and thank god they gave me a special velvet pouch which is excellent in quality looking premium .."
Its a very bad earphone....dont buy it...its have only...bass .its very terrible......not more than 2 min....we listen th song
Ear phones are nice but in high volume the base is hard and sound cracks. Main drawback is it doesnt work with Laptop.
This earphone is best with design and sound. It have incredible look and totally worth of money.
It easily fits in the ear.Ear fins are thin....great for school kids.
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
 Bad quality...... Colour faded... Packet was already opened...... And not good sounds.
"Very good value when in offer you get it for 450 rs, i bought this second time, so there is nothing negative to alk about so far at this price point"
"At the price of 499, you will get a quality product. Music lovers will love the bass. Only cons I see is due to high bass, sometimes you will not be able to hear properly during phone calls or during meetings."
"It is good but not as expected. I was using Basshead 225, as compared to that I didn't like built quality of 242. sound quality is not as good as 225.Currently, both are available at the same price, so go for 225 over 242."
It causes me a severe headache... I'm using various earphones from years but it's most uncomfortable one ever had.1) yeah this set of earphone perfectly fit your ears but it'll cause pain in ear i mean not comfortable.2) sound quality isn't good.
"I like this product because, these earphones are very very good quality and sound quality , bass quality , noise cancellation are very very amazing and build quality also betterAnd very comfort for jogging and also daily useOverall earphones is very good,amazing,better.Thanks boat"
It's outstanding I using it since I buy it it's sound is excellent I highly recommend for this product the last boAt rocking. :)
Not a great product to buy as compared to bass heads 255 it is best for someone who just needs earphones thats it no bass no loud voice no nothing
"I have used this earphone in two phone'sI have face connection problem in both phones it always makes ""kar kar"" sounds after connection and sound quality also not that goodOnly pro is it fits perfectly in my ears"
good sound quality but cannot wear for longtime as it will start paining in your ears maybe because of its design.
"Been using it for about a month.It's comfortable to use, the cable is adequately long, sound quality is decentIt comes with a black carry pouch, so travel- friendly"
- Bass is not good.- Noise cancellation not at all working.- Only voice clarity during music playback is good which we can get from any less costly earphone.

" Sound quality is Good ,Comfortable Fit to EarsWire length & Quality is GoodWorthable for this Price Range🎧"
"A great product. I was a bit sceptical about this product but after using this, I am really enjoying this. A good buy !!!!!"
"The microphone volume is very low and a lot of disturbance. I use it for calls and recordings. The call receivers have difficulty in hearing my voice, despite max volume"
"Sound Quality : 4/5Noise Cancellation : 3.4/5Bass Quality : 3.4/5In Conclusion, I will say that Don't Expect Very Good Quality on Low Budget. If you need Quality then Buy Headbands around Rs 2,000."
vocal based sound profile. Good for Youtube and Audio Books. Not for music.
Lightweight but not comfortable to ears.Jack is straight which is a difficult design as compared to bassheads 225
The volume button works automatically when connected to the phone and sometimes the right ear piece won't work properly within 1 month of purchase..what a waste..the sound quality was good but what's the point if it doesn't work
As per expectation good light set sound quality good too
"I've also used the 225 which comes at same price almost, but The 242 is better in Design and in Sound quality Too.Packing was good also and their customer service is also quite Good."
"Within only a month of usage, the left earbud started to not work properly. Turning the jack left and right while connected causes sound disturbance on both of the buds, and sometimes one of the buds stops working. This product isn't gonna last for more than a few months. Not worth it."
"Bass , sound quality and Noise cancellation is good at this price. But After 1 month Right one is not working properly and After 2 days Right one is working and left is not working."
It will take some time to get use to the fit. But overall 4 out of 5 star for the sound.
The bass was good enough noise cancelling works fine but on my first order it cannot connect to my device at once and sometimes mic does not work while on call but thanks to Amazon I replaced that order now everything works good
"Awesome earplugs , dont waste money in buying expensive earplugs this earplugs earplugs are worth more than 500/-ProsBest soundBest comfortablityProper length1 year warrantyWhat else you want"
"Sound quality is bad. Before this earphone I used mi earphone for 2 years. That was very good sound quality. After mi I thought boat will be better than it. But I was wrong. If anyone reading this, I request you to not buy this product."
Bought this 242 wired headset as I was looking for some headset that would work atleast an year.I've already used Boat wireless headset which I'm happy with. More due to excellent customer services I received.
This is easily breakable material... Unlike other earphones this will break easily when gets jammed inside pocket or if you accidentally sit on it.. and also performance is average
I've been using boat 242 for 5 months and here is my experience with them. Everything is comes up with good quality but net mesh. Their net meshes are so vulnerable that they started losing their place after a few weeks.
"I bought this earphone before an year , I'm writing this as an year review, so I really feel it's great sound quality is also good, the only problem is that the earpiece is of sone low quality and it sometimes gets off so it was the Only problem I faced."
Nice product best quality best basses and nice talking ..lovely earfone but 4month use  one side speaker stoped
buy it everything is good at this price range 400-500
I just loved it... I was looking at the ear phones and that is soo good and loved the pakaging of boat company ❤️❤️❤️... I have never received a carry pouch bt boat provides that in it...and some extra buds and a warrenty card
Nice earphones. Sound quality etc are really good. Very good buy for the price.
"Ita good, easily fit in ears,Sound quality is quite good for which boat is known for."
The product is good. But not recommended for iPhone. Maybe iPhone 6s.
I always found earphone not fit for my ears but these are completely fit and best for sports. Sound quality is awesome and noise cancellation is pretty good.
Go for black colour.... The black colour has better strong wire
Long lasting . Good looking . For gaming first I didn't liked it . When I used more than 50 times it's ok for me to play game like bgmi. So cool one . Not bad .
Everything is perfect in this headset only one uncomfortable is the control switch is on right side.
Very very bad product 😞😞😞 don't West u r Money after 1week Stop warking . I contact to boat clear they told me it will replace but that people take time of1month .so please don't buy boat product go with JBL .
Not good with noice cancellation. Good for 🎵 music. Fair product @ this price range.
Worst headphones in this price segment lsound like a 100 rs headphone.After replacement may be i have received used product.
Well good at this price... But these rubbers which looks right angle makes discomfort... Other than that perfect bass... And perfect for sound quality... Excellent for calls.. BUT not good at noise cancellation....
"The sound quality was perfect for just a week nd both the sides had stopped functioning after that . This has been a common thing among boat products.  Don't buy below rs 1000 products from boat , it always comes with a defect"
I love boat product but sometimes the is problem with delievered product
"I didn't expect much from the product initially, but after I used the product I found that the sound quality is very good.Product quality is good.My personally rating about the product is 4.5"
"The fit was not a perfect or a snug fit, the hooks were rubbing against ear and causing too much pain. The sound quality is worse than other boat earphones. No bass as many customer reviews I have read."
Sound quality is really good ..!! Can't say anything about build quality as of now looks good but needs more look into it but 449 it's worth ..!! If your boatbass225 then you don't need this one !!
Awsome product if we are fools. Completly useless... but value for money..... used it for almost 4 months...
Sound quality is good but noise cancellation ia very poor. Except this earphone we can't get such a sound quality & premium bass experience earphone in this price segment.
"After using one week, the earphone is not supporting call there is no voice coming from speaker and also the mic is unresponsive.But it is ok with music playing."
Does not fit in the ears properly. There is no Notice cancellation at all. Not suitable for one who uses headphones while workouts
"Got all the accessories mentioned and sound quality is good but some times the sound is loud, I didn't like ear hooks, good for calls, overall good wired earphones from boat."
I am very disipointed by this product. Sound quality was not bad. Because of cheap quality plastic earphone broke.
"The worst product ever. The sound quality is terrible. The product boxand shipping box came damaged to me and when I used them they were like, it was whispering in my ear,and most importantly they were already used by someone for a long time, say for 2 to 3 months very roughly"
"In the field of audio delivery, quality, and durability there is no better company than Boat right now, very affordable prices and the best experience to actually use their product, you can just buy any original boat product without a doubt and it will match your expectations..."
Product is okay but wire quality is average.  Didn't last long for me due to some connectivity issue due to the quality of wire
"Wire quality is good.Ibuy this earphones only for its tangle free wire and for its bass quality.In my opinion this is a worthy product,excellent product,Bass is superb.Super tangle free wire is awesome.Worthy prouduct."
Sound qualiy is good bass is extremely good and this is totally worth buying this earphone at his nominal price.Thanks team boat.
If u bass lover then definitely go for this. U will need quality song with little modified mobile or laptop settingsIt is far better than boat 225
"when I connect earphone with my device it's started misbehaving like automatically media player opened and song is getting played, getting paused again playing, making call auto , stopping -- it's just looping.... disappointed"
"No second thoughts !!!!Guys it’s a perfect oneGood soundGood noise cancellationAlso it will fit in our ears perfectlyBut, bass quality is not too good but ok"
Blue colour earphones doesn't have secured braided cable whereas thr active black one has it. So please do not order blue colour cable. The cable was very delicate and will be torn with regular usage.
Quality of sound is poor on these earphones. The only good thing in there earphones is bass. Ear hooks are painful after few minutes of use. Quality of earhooks and earbuds is also poor. I suggest you to buy 220 instead of these(242).
"Please dont buy their products i buy a headphone on october 2020 and then in january the one side of the earphone is not working i register a complaint they doesn't response it, then i buy this product now i face the same problem in it... Please dont buy it 🙏"
Bass is good but call quality is noisy. So I don't recommend it at all.
Positive1) very light2) has good fit in ears3) Does not fall from ear4) decent sound and bassNegative1) Cause pain in ear after wearing long hours
"Bud housing feel is ittle bit cheaper plasticy, wire and sound signature quality average..don't expect too much."
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
" Volume button is not working, volume up and down button is working for the next song to be played and not volume. Others are okay, bass quality is good"
Sounds quality is superb I love this product but if you go for build quality its good not Excellent if if are seeing this product with it’s price range its good I bought it only 375 👍👍
Durable! Exactly what I need.I've had gazillion experience with wired headset.Because of the cost I switched to cheapos.But I decided buy the boat and it's definitely worth it.
Not satisfied with this earphone.Bought it 4 months ago and now right sided earphone is not working properly and sometimes not the person I am talking to is not able to hear me out...very much disappointed with this particular boat earphone
The wire quality and overall material is not good and prone to break as of mine has happened.And not having 3 months from buying it has started problem in one of the pair .Thus I got disappointed by this buy .
The earphones are good but the microphone is catching the earphone's audio. I've try other earphones by boat but all of them have the same problem.
Stopped working within 6 months and the ear prices kept falling off and had to be replaced by the extras given
"not the best boat earphones, i have used many boat earphones, mic is not good"
Really worth the money. Bass is not too overpowering. You can go for these instead of Sennheiser considering the price.
Loved this earphone its bass is out standing... build quality is great...if you're getting it for 449... Grab it. It's better than boat 225 and ant w56.. good for jogging. Design is not so Good but build quality is great. Get black color earphones. And cherry on top is it's has volume control buttons too... nobody gives volume control buttons in this price.
The one side of the earphone was not working in 4 months then I have to go and replace it. They do replace it without much problem so yeah happy with that but its not good that they stopped working properly in just 4 months
Good quality with high Bass
"Boat earphones are really good, I suggest to all who are searching to buy branded earphones."
Pathetic headphone! The jack was loose enough that it would stop playing kusic and at some times cancelled calls when speaking to someone.. terrible! Not recommended at all
The size of the earphone is not good as there are not  fit to  ears they are easily fall back from  ears very inconvenient to wear and listen songs and videos and they are also very painful to ears due to their size as they are not easily fitted to ears.
"Ok product @399, not worth more than that. Realme buds2 is the best option which I am using for more than a year. I am not disappointed either with this product. Bass could have been better."
The sound almost stopped in the left ear bud.This is the third boat earphones with same problem ...May be boat earphones are not for me ....
Bass is not that high although the sound is clear. You have to put your mic up close to mouth in order to get better voice quality over Teams meeting and calls.
"Such a "" WODERFUL "" product. I've been using this from last 7 months and everything is just great as new product. Once it was washed-out  with my trousers but still it is as great as nothing has happened to it. None of my earphones have been working for such a long time"
Sound quality is amazing and all ok extra ear buds not available in this pouch already pack inside open ear buds missing
"To say about this product is overall its a nice product, no dislikes about this product"
A perfect balance of highs and lows. Call quality is also very good.Tip: Just remove that ear hooks and it will perfectly fit into your ear. It's just a showpiece. It has no added benefit.
"I had ordered this product in the month of February, and it was working fine until now when I'm on a call the person on the other line is unable to hear my voice.There is a product warranty of one year, please help fix this issue."
The best budget headphones ever. I could only count house of Marley as ab exception. Close your eyes and go for it.
Seriously boat giving it a sporty earphones tag and then this build quality is really disgusting after changing one time in 1 week again after 15 days the voice is becoming zero automatically nd really disappointed by this product
Third class quality
I got different color. And the sound quality was also not so good.
"Searching for a earphone for multipurpose use like gaming music etc in a limited budget, then this one is for you."
Best earphones I ever used..crystal clear sound..have been using it from last 6 months and still working excellently... outstanding product at this price range..aankh bund kar ke le lo
"Simply waste product, design, color as not like in picture (dark), bottom pin too small, getting ear pain after continue use for 10 minutes"
Good one...Nice sound quality and good bass one problem is material quality. Need to improve material quality bit more otherwise it's cool.
"Sound quality is better. Bass is better but , before buying this product if you put more expectations about this product, surely you will get disappointment. Overall this Reasonable for this price."
"Earphone stopped working, Tried to call to ask the warranty related info...full day i couldn't able to contact the customer care number full days it's busy and i sent mail to them no response...Very disappointed"
"If i press next button it is pausing, can't able to go frwd nd backwrd, so i returned it, i won't recommend it."
Product failed within a month use mic and volume buttons stopped.. and service center didnot responding for my query
weird noise sometimes randomly.Good lookGood soundGood bassGood volume controlRandom Weird noise sometimes.
pros-1. good quality sound.cons-1. cheap material2. uncomfortable for ears if wear it for more than an hour3. this thing will not last longer than 2-3months.
"Verry good quality product. Sound, wear quality, bess quality verry good. Also i found 4pcs headphones rabar and soft cotton bag..In 500rs worth this product.Sound like home theater 😍😍"
"Earphone is very stylish in look with bright colour. Sound quality (Bass, Treble) is quite nice. Noice cancellation is extremely good. But the only problem is the earphone is not comfortable actually after putting it for 3-4 hours the ears starts paining.So overall you can go for it but comfortness is the only zzzzzz."
Headphone sound is not continuous..if just there a little movement..it will stop working..after 1 month I have to make my statue to get continously clear voice..this was not expected.. i will give only 1 star..my bad luck i had gone for it
"Low audio quality, mic not working, stopped working after returning time expired."
Not up to the mark.. bass is not that much satisfying to me while listening to eltro or House music..
"Loved the product as it's very durable in build quality, sounds good and overall I am totally satisfied with it"
I'm dislike this product for poor quality.it was very bad experience with this brand product
"The sound quality is very good if you are abass lover. Yet the surround sound is perfect and voices are clear. Very loud if you like soft music. It's not very comfortable to wear long time, ears start hurting. The in hear hook pains after some time. The built quality is very bad."
Frankly speaking i was not expecting very much. But the bass is great. Sound quality is awesome. Definitely recommended to o everyone who wants a nice headphones for their personal use.
"I have used boat roackerz Bluetooth headphone 🎧 before so i had no doubts on the sound quality , I was concerned about the wire quality it seems poor but it's okey it can handle rough usage ... I haven't seen any damage on wire so far"
"The voice quality is good but when I wear them, there is a constant vacuum created. After wearing them long also get a little pain and dumbness in ears."
"Worst product I purchased till date, volume control doesn't work, can not answer the call. Not worth to buy.... I don't recommend this to anyone.I think it's a copy of boat brand. Don't spoil the brand Amazon."
"Ok for listening, not good for office online calls, web meeting your voice will be very low other party not able hear, even if you are shouting"
"I just bought it. And sound qaulity is great, Fits perfectly in ear but not comfortable after 3 to 4 hours. For that you need them to take out and then put them in. The 3.5 mm pin is not angled here. But ovarall god product at this price range."
"It looks stylish on the outside but built is poor. One ear stopped working after 5 months. Sound is okay, no added bass as such, you will get the same sound quality from a Rs. 300 earphone. Overall there are better options available"
Bass quality is too good. But sound quality is not that type of clear. Some buzzing sounding is there. Overall it's a good quality bass boosted earphone in affordable price.I got this at 449
thayli thik thak hai par thoda or achha ho sakta tha agar ye chamde ka hota to our ye jyada der estemal nhi par 6 ghanta tak estemal kar sakte hai ye utna bhi aram dyak nhi hai baki hai 500 ke thik hai
Paisa vasoolNo negatives but gotta say this is an underrated productWorth the penny spent
I bought this on August . Now I am using this headphone with three months . Still it's work fine and also water resistant good bass quality good sound it's an must buy product go for it .....
Using for 7 months and right now I'm facing an issue. The left side isn't working or responding. The sound quality is decent after using all these months.
Sound and bass great .. build Quality is also good .. it is indian brand .. it price worthy product.. buy it.
The earphones mute automatically no matter how many times I try to increase the volume. It's been just 20 days since I bought it. They say it has 1 year warranty but product can be replaced only within 15 days of purchase.
10 din me hi Iss ki celerity gadbad ho gayi... Call pe bat karte vakt samne vale ko avaj bhi nahi ja rahi hai... Bohot hi ganda Experience hai boat ka.... Please don't by
"Superb quality sound and bass, If you want to buy a good headphones with you budject then go for this headphones, simply superb.  Iam loving it,  but delivery too late. Dear Amazon kindly keep eye on this Delhivery courier service other than you are doing great job.Gopinath"
It's sound quality is good and they are very comfortableBut the only thing which I think can be improved is Wire QualityOtherwise this earphone is worth of its price
Great earphones.... simply awesome... Great look and over the top noise cancellation as claimed...the noise cancellation is so good that someone was shouting right in my ear n I couldn't hear it...😅😅 The secure ear hooks are well fitted in the right ear...but in left it's a little awkward fit....overall fine earphones in this price range.
"Everything's superb, except the box was already torn off. Feels like a used product."
"As nowadays it has become norm.on amazon got a opened and used up product. Returned it and got new one second time.Good. Quality headphones,Nice Sound and. Tangle Free wire"
Bad experience with this Nokia mobile i was order on 8.06.2021 and just just after 2 monthskeypad not working it was very bad experience first time with amazon.
Overall a good product but lacks in longetivity.
I have ordered black with red boat symbol.Performance wise it's quality is good.Looks wise iam not satisfied. My expectation was something else. But can't say it's too bad.OverallWorth the money. Should not expect anything more from 500rs headsets.
The microphone and mouthpiece is situated at  both side of the ears. So it's helpful while talking.
It is good product with good sound quality but the wire quality is not great. It might come out if you accidentally strick it with hand
Good sound quality and bass. Supports noice cancellation.
The product is good. Earphone sound quality is too good and and wires are long.i got it for 399 🤩.  The  audio jack is 3.5 mm and it is fitting in my realme 2 pro mobile  earphone jack perfectly. Happy to have it. Thank you boat the best
The product design is defective. It's not at all comfortable on the ears and the rough edges of gives you a painful ear . Just wasted 500 bucks. Bad decision. 👎👎👎👎👎
good.... Started ear paining after sometime use.. so I had to return it
I had purchased these boat headphones on Feb 2022 .  You peoples sending out damaged product and fooling me
I liked everything and except the sound heard in the earphones will be audible to others as well while we are listening something or any mobile conversation.
Sound quality is better than 225 but Not sure about near pin is doubtful.
"seems cable is good quality but upper part where is mic that must be as thick as lower part...in some pics there was cover over it ..but in this not y i don't know.That is problem , it may not last long may break somewhere where it is fragile n thin."
I think this is a used product...the box wasnt sealed..and this is not the first time i am receiving a unsealed box by amazon...and whenever i insert the cable in my phone it makes some noise..a request to amazon to deliver original and unused products which r sealed.
"One of the worst product as it stopped working after two months of normal usage. Earpiece has stopped working, only if I adjust the jack or the earpiece, it starts to work and after some time, the same issue."
Within one month right side earphone was not working.
"You can go for it, it's been a month I am using, it does tangle, not a lot but in a normal amout, bass is okay, the wires attached to the earphones are too thin, mic is okay."
Good audio for the rate ! Might jar at high volumes but overall a good rate on audio. The lobes do hurt due to the head make But it depends on how it fit each person !Overall a good one for budget!

 Boat bass heads 242 has very very cheap or poor build quality Don't buy this it reuined my 30k rupess phone  the 3.5 mm pin stuck in my 3.5 mm phone's jack I want my refund
"Cost is on higher side, while the material quality needs improvement. A better quality cable /wire could have been provided at such a high price."
Boat 242 fulfilled my expectation its bass is superb definitely it deserve 5***** Star. thankyou.
"Quality was good until it worked, but one ear stopped working after 3 months. And boat customer care is annoying. They claim to have door to door replacement, but I can't get through to customer care.Super disappointing."
"Siund qualiy is with this price ,you can buy ,i just bought dont know how much it will last.."
Previously i had bought same model & had a good experience however this time when i bought 2 piece of same model but unfotunatley Product quality is very poor.... I really disappointed with this service... Even Amazon havent helped me.
If you want to take a handsfree up to ₹ 500-549 then you can look for any other brand.It has a  problems with the bass sound. noise cancellationnot at all. It's totally based  on my experience
"Its good but not that grt.. , can get a btrr option at a lower price:.."
"It's Not working anymore, that's less than a month, The jack is loose, and I need to claim warrenty. How can I do so?P.S. There was a continuous static in the background of whatever is being played the entire time.Highly recommended to NOT BUY!"
"Very disappointing. There is no bass, no sound quality. It's just that we can hear sound that's it. Didn't expect that from boat. Hated it.Secondly it cannot be returned."
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
" Nice product in this price range , little issue facing in noise cancellation. Overall nice product"
"Good pair of headfones.Used for more than 15 days and workin fine and serves its purpose. Rs549 is good price for the product and vice versa. Comfortable, good quality in the price range."
Earphone is good it is provide nice sound but mic was not good you not do calling in rushed areas. Not good for calling otherwise the built quality was okay and sound was okay on this Price range you not expected too much.
boat never disappoint... all products of boats are best.. mivi in same segment is worst..always go for boat..
Good one at this price range but expecting more sturdier.
"The product is very good for the price. Gives crystal clear sound. The design of the earphone is very effective in blocking the sounds around you, so that you can clearly hear every sound that comes from the earphone. I am delighted with this earphone."
"It arrived without the secure fit ear hooks, and when I plugged it in my phone and played some media nothing could be heard, i received a defective and a non operational product. Highly do not recommend to buy. Please do not buy it."
These earphones are excellent... I liked it
"Very cheap product received from all the aspect.i.e.sound quality,bass,material of product.Jack damaged within month with light usage.Amazon not supported for this.Worse experience of online fact product network at amazon."
These are very bad earphone..the sound coming from it is very sharp even the bass quality is very bad. And i can't even return it because there is no option..very disappointed
My day starts with this product. Value for money. 🏃‍♂️
"Using them for too long(say, more than an hour will start paining in the ears). Not comfortable at all. But okay for short durations, especially for the price."
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
 Product quality is not good one side ear speake not working due to wire quality not good from the joint of both speakers wires. Now request you to please replace it under warranty
.Very worst I'm using this headphone just for one month now it's not working no physical damage 😑😡
You Need Great Sound & Best Music Experience then This Is Right ChoicePrice Little HighI Think 399 Better Price But Its Ok For MeI'M HAPPY 😊
You can use ut upto three months. After that one of the pieces should not be workingQuality is okay
It was gud but after a couple of weeks I could feel pain where the ear buds placed.
I purchased the product I used it xfor 3 days and I noticed that it sound so bad (it produces harsh sound ) and I feel uncomfortable so I replaced it so now waiting for replaced product for arrival
"Perfect for all ear size, fits well"
sound quality is superb. bass is also good.build quality is not upto mark against dog bite(found out the hard way) :/
"Not a great product, seems a bit bulky on ears and not a very great sound effects also. Just good to have a earphone"
"Bass bass bass! Amazing sound. Sound is not loud but crystal clear i If I compare jbl to headphones, these headphones win because the bass is very high and good in it. I will recommend these headphones to the bass lover."
Its a good product for 500rsWhen I watching the movies in mobile I get some theatre experience alsoNot only that also it is more comfortable and also the sound is excellentI loved it it I giving 5 stars 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
Buttons of the product are not working since we got it and they are not even exchanging 😔 rest everything is good but as they show in pic with ear support know that support is only for showoff earphones doesn't provide any support to ear😔😔
Very nice 👍Awesome product
it looks good and sounds good.
It's a good product. It doesn't have a built in mice as description says. Otherwise it's worth buying
The sound quality is to good and the noise cancellation is very good thn JBL I would recommend u to take it and it's at affordable price and I will suggest to take this at Amazon Great Indian sale time it's to  affordableAt last I give 5/5 to it
Not good if you are looking for great bass.
It's better not to buy. In beginning product was amazing but later on its annoying. Mic sometimes work sometime not . Sounds keep fluctuating. Terrible experience
Sound quality is okay overall mic is good too but the only problem with this was the build quality it feels cheap like a 100rs earphone and I've used realme buds before so I can tell you they are way better than this one
Excellent product. I bought it for 499. This ear phone last long time year for me. No other ear phones at this price can be used for this long. That i wire was broken otherwise it would last few more months
Start re-enjoying the old melodies I love. It is serving my audible books truly. A sturdy and value-for-money product.
Sound quality is of the highest order and so is the bass quality and nosie cancellation feature in the headphones
"I think this earphone is best in budget 499 everything is best in this earphone sound quality,bass, noice cancellation everything. But, the product quality is too weak plastic is used in ear piece and wire quality is also thin looking so cheap."
Sound quality is good but not very good mic. I often need to hold the mic in hand while in meetings as people often complaint that my voice is breaking.I thought the clip in mic would help but sometimes even then i have to hold it in hand.
"Audio quality is good but bulit quality in no too good, I already exchanged one time but again facing same issue with headphone jack."
It is a good product and worth your money. But the earbud design is a bit uncomfortable for long use.
I think this is just me but these are not that comfortable that huge plastic part have too many edges and those edges dig into skin and the rubber tip hole is larger as compared to other brandsIll just say just buy jbl earphones
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
" Amazon delevered Local quality earphone , when parsal  deliver me earphone box was seal broken and I replace earphone 2nd time also same situation  , poor voice,poor built quality ,Money waste item"
"This is by far the worst earphones I ever bought, after using for 13 days this earphone starting to malfunction and the sound from one of the side is gone. Cheap Rs.50 earphones which are sold in bus and railway station lasts longer than this earphone.I recommend not to ever buy this product."
I used first time boat product and its really awesome sound and Bass .. Extremely great product ..and its also cheap in price ....and i really recommend to everyone to buy this product1. Sound 5/52. Bass 5/53. Design 5/54. Delivery by Amazon 5/55. Build 5/5
"I get this product 1 years ago, the sound and bass quality is good, as was earlier, it's 10mn driver and ipx4/water Resistant and 3.5nm jack, it's good in Budget But noise cancellation Are issues."
"When i received the package, the seal was opened. Extra pair of earbuds are missing and the wire was stuffed badly in the package..Sound, build quality are really good at this price.Earbuds are a bit uncomfortable."
Improve Build Quality... This is 5th month.. The Green colour is actually a plastic paper u wrapped around a.. Headphone Jack and Mic. Its not Paint coated material. U just wrapped it through green plastic paper. And it getting off now. I literally wrapped tep around heaphone jack...a
Sound quality good in general and color looks more pleasing than in product image.... Critical music lovers may need better options though
AhahahahWhat a product man..!!The bass treble everything is perfectly managedJust blown my mind..!At this price range the quality boat is providing is iust OP..!#IAmAboAthead
Very nice product. Look is also good
More than 200 percentage better ...to compare Boult earbuds 1999/- TWS 120HRS ...PLAY BACK PRODUCT ...I GIVE IT 5 OUT OF 9 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐NOTE:- right one Boult earbuds 1999/-
Worst productDesign not fit for earSound and Bass quantity not proper.I won't suggest these product.
"It's  first impression was just awesome. Good amount of base, clear vocals, braided cable and a carry case. Excellent for gaming like valorant. This is just perfect for 399rs."
Not good sound quality as i expect form this earphone. I bought it for my office use. I disappointed with sound quality. So I gifted it  to my bro
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
 The microphone stopped working with in a few days of buying. Want a refund immediately The quality of sound is average and can not listen for long time.
Within few days left Side speaker is not working
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
" EditedOne side is not workingThe name is Bassheads but here Bass is missing! Jack is not L shape that's why plugin and plug out is difficult,Wire is not tangel free........"
So the overall earphone is best in segment and value for money but you can feel a buzzz sound when you play something that's the only problem and without lime and black colour you won't get a pvc pipe guard
"Good sound quality and noise cancellation, it fits in any ear without getting popped out."
Quality is very good but cover/case is not good please give up the new cover/case box type. Otherwise i'll return this product beacuse costly items is valuable for take care please give the new cover/case like box type.Thanks&regards
Never buy boat productsThis is my 3rd boat earphones and as always it started malfunctioning mic is not working and service centers they have are worst not ready to replace even when warranty is still remaining.
"Bass, Noise cancellation, & Sound quality is Awesome 😎"
Not attractive...but okay...not worth for the price especially black pic shows black earbuds but delivered grey colour which looks worst ...i wish it could be replaced and get a complete black coloured headset of the same product.
"Good sound reproduction, mix is also good. It catches the radio frequency of phone and creats a painful situation very often."
Writing this review after using for 3months. Initially it is having connectivity problem. Later one side earbud stop working. Now voice or music coming out from phone like a speaker.
Value for money.. nice sound
"Mic doesn't work properly, I have to hold the mic near my mouth to use it otherwise it's not working ... Very disappointed with mic quality... If you often used mic then you should go for this otherwise it's useless"
"Great quality, thanks amazon"
"Voice बहुत ज्यादा बाहर आती है boat के other products मे इतने ज्यादा voice बाहर नहीं आती है , base भी अच्छा नहीं है full volume पर आवाज चुबन सी लगती है, यह problem सिर्फ मेरे earphone ke साथ है तो I need replacement ."
Fully satisfied with the productDon't hesitateGo for it 👍
The internal net of left earphone is torn completely just within 7 days of delivery. Complaint is considered as invalid. Unable to speak to customer care employee.
"Well its lower than Intermediate quality. Dont buy this one, buy the one with a braided cable for 500 bucks... Its worth the money.. This one is just bleh."
"Product is gud, only thing is for longer usage ear bud wil start  pain .takes tym to adjust with this.Bas quality  is ok gud fr pubg toSound is higher need to adjust."
It's very good product.I purchased Oct 2020 but some issues in wire is slightly broken.One year warranty is expired on Oct 2021can you replace this product or i purchased new one.pl.give feedback
Boat products should spend atleast a fraction of money in quality that they spend in Advertisement. I ordered first time. It was detective. Then replacement was also defective. I ordered the same in Flipkart. Same defect there also.
"Those who are searching for the earphones and reading this comment, i am suggesting you this. This is probably the best one for budget earphones with quality, bass and stylish design. Don't miss it...i am using this and mad at it."
Every thing is on its own league. we can even compare it with jbl or Skullcandy. But all of this come with its own downside ie. quality 💩💩
I don’t know why but my friend also purchased same boat bassheads 242 in orange color but my headset base is very low than my friend’s headset.What is this behaviour boAt.So choose headset with color also :)
It is ok type earphone. It looks cool but sound is ok ok. Bass is good. While talking to some one on phone call other guy listen his own voice if I use this earphone for my phone.
Excellent product with good sound quality. This product has excellent noise cancellation support and you can control bass quality as per your requirements.  Excellent product .  Value for money.
In the beginning it's working properly but later on it's facing so many issues like self volume ups & down. Self video pause. I tried in 2 to 3 different device but facing same issue
Speaker is very bad produce lots of noice and noice cancelation is very low..
Just bought the earphones. Sound quality is excellent. Bass is good. They gave a small pouch to keep your earphones in it. Comfortable in wearing.Overall a great product within this price range.
"This earphones making constant buzzing sound in background. So, please don't buy it. I order it and replace it but, im facing the same problem with both earphones. So, i returned this earphone."
"sound quality is excellent, Vera level bass and crisp and clear sound quality,Highly recommended for the segment"
"I have seen reviews so I get to know to change my ear phone to boat, I have seen previous boat sounds.This brand is good and ear phone is for bass"
totally waste of moneyafter 15days ...one side of bud did not work and this is the major problem on this.i had replaced this item and get new boat bass earphones but again it happens with the new one after few days. now i can't replace it .
Good..I bought them for 399/-..I donno whether this is best buy or not...But I satisfied with my purchase...
"Design and colour are of a Cheap productSound quality is awesomeOnce the rubber bud is removed from it, it's difficult to reset it. I'm still using it without rubber bud. Anyway, it's value for money"
"3rd quality headset. Very disappointed to see such a product from Boat. Zero Bass, high treble, extremely uncomfortable to listen. Worst than local made 50 rupees earphone."

 Best product  from boat super sound quality  and excellent  bass but do not use long time in full volume still problem in head
"After using this stupid earphone you will start feeling pain inside your ear and  sound quality is worst , Please do not buy this earphone this is the worst earphone I have ever used in my life 😑😑😑😑😑😑"
The build and sound quality is really worth the price.
Its a DJ felling sound 🔊...  Best sports earphones in this...  In this priceजिन्हे soft hd sound psnd h unke lie nhi h ye earphones...
"Headphone material is very poor quality plastic material , it's brake after 2 month use. Sound quality also very poor. Very poor quality by BOAT,"
Flawless Performance. I bought it and felt sad for buying chinese product. Buy any other Non-Chinese Product.
I am having a sound problem and one of the side is not working...it's having a loose connection....I gave a complaint 30 days back and still I didn't get my replacement this is happened to my 3 rd pair of boat earphones...the quality is amazing but the life time is low..I need a replacement plzz anyone reply ...
Boat is always reliable. I have got a 1-year warranty on this. Now let us see how it works.
"excellent sound.i got it in hand within 3 days of ordering..treble,bass is having normal output,not harming for ears...it has volume control button...and a play pause button,by which you can change to next song by double pressing the play button"
"If compared to the other brands in this price segment, boAt is unbeatable, probably the best quality bass, perfect fitting and a pocket friendly price.Loved it..."
Good for long hours of usage. Especially when you are used to listening music for more than an hour.Fits perfect in your ears and the tips ain't giving any inconveniences when using for more than an hour.
"No quality in sound , one side not working properly, One side bass not working, with in two weeks of working, i get 2time same complaint with same model , not recommend for anyone."
It's pretty cool and with bass sounds really good... Worth for the price and it has got cute pouch to store... Over all it deserves more than price
"good sq, bass not as bass boost but quite good for hearing similar sound as sennhiser base model ...got for if you have lots of sports left..."
Just loved it.  I am using it extensively for past month and very happy with performance. Go for it.
overall best in 500rs but its inline buttons are not working with my note 5 pro model but it is working on redmi 4a.I don't know what is the exact problem if the earphone is not supported or my phone have some issue but this product is definitely meet your expectations when you purchase it.
It stopped working after a month of purchase...
"I am using these earphones and they are really good , but there is a problem that small euarbuds are slightly sharp and if use them for more than 30 min your ears will get hurt. But overall it is good."
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
 Very good sound quality
Don't buy worst earphone ever! The price is cheap because of these earphone are coming with manufacturer defact i replace my earphone 2 times! Because of one side not working after 25 days!
Sound quality didn't like much its not crystal clear its like a broken glass sound but bass is ok…its not a noise cancellation but it fits nicely and soft for mg sons ears…
Got spoiled within 2 weeks of buying a very messy pridecut.  I am very sad to buy boat earphone
"It is good for short duration but after 30 minutes, my ear has pain."
"Really amazing product no doubt on the quality, sound is clear crisp,  if anyone wants to purchase do immediate worth to buy this product"
Nice headphones ..Value for money.....But Trouble is not that much good. Clarity not good when volume increase at max level this happen with laptop only(windows 10 os) mobile sound much good.
"Good product but the base is not very high, clear sound good earphone but if someone likes high base they may not like this."
Awesome!!I am the one music lover and always don't compromise about music.  After several check points I decided to buy this Boat head phone. It's true awesome and affordable everyone. Go for it💞💯♥️♥️
"Writing this after 10months.... Best part of the head phone is it's Bass... Awesome bass... Vocal and treble is also quite good...better than jbl C50HI,T50HI and realme buds 1&2...Some time's feel am in front of a DJ 😀...Basshead 242+Dolby atmos+ EDM👌👌👌👌"
"Sound quality is better than mi basic earphonesBetter bass and treble nd vocals are loud enoughBut the build quality is not the best in this price segment.Lightweight , good fitting earphonesYou can definitely go for it."
The earphones and their functioning is good. Mic quality is also reasonable. But it's not tangle-free. It gets tangled.
I would like to say that you should purchase it. It is worth of.
"What more could I expect from AMAZON!THANK YOU for the service!Even after raising a compliant., You delivered a substandard product, which needs no unboxing!!! Look at the pictures..."
Built in quality is good. Fitting is good. But sound quality is not as expectation. Bass is good but if we add aditional bass with music player bass distorted.Good for sports persons.
One of the best earphone and best service by boat too.After 9 months of working it's mic burned from in side how ever it was in warranty period so they picked up from home and replaced it with new oneBEST SERVICE!!!!
"Very good in bass, treble and clarity..... Backup is also ver good .....just go for it...."
"One more boAt accessory added to my collection. This is worth purchasing, it's sound quality is unbeatable at this price.I'll recommend this foresurely especially for office purpose."
Low Quality. There was an earphone foult I had ordered before. And 2nd product of rubber break in 1 month less usage. Better to think go for other brand.
"The product was just awesome.,you get the very best for the price,bass is awsome but in some cases u hear music much than the artist....a voice becomes a bit flat when the bass punches,but boats r meant for this and it will do it's job well"
Sound Quality:- you will frgt where you are ...awesomeBass Quality:- i really Suggest this thing who love high bassNoise Cancellation:- Awesome....nothing can hear from outside...once you start hearing the musicSimply Awesome...build Quality too...🤩🤩👍👍👍
Nice product when you compare the price. Sound quality is good. Good built quality and the wire coating which they have given is superb because it wont stick or won't cause to get any knots because of the slippery nature of tha wires.
After 10 day one side not working
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
" Bass very high, Dolby not sound not included ,headset not fit 👂"
"Amazing monsters,as promised by boat totally satisfied...♥️👌 but only one drawback is during call there's still bass is too much can't attend a call without pain in the ears so frustrating...."
looking great but i will give more detail review after using this 1 or 2 months.nice packing & potaly for handling this headphone.Thanks Boat
"Totally disappointed with this product, as it's not working on my android/ios device, the volume keys aren't working, even the other party is getting hissing sound while talking using microphone."
"They headphones they first delivered to me has defects in mic set , so I ordered for a replacement,but the replacement order also has defects with mic set. So if anyone orders the product please check with your mic set first"
"What is there not to like , only one problem is that it is not made for pubg but still you can use it as it has dynamic drive (BASS) and believe a very dangerous one ,it's E P I C ."

 Its sound is very clear and noise cancelling is also amazing. It's produces a balanced sonund between audio and bass. I really like it.
All fine but the the colur of the product is differentInstead of orange it is yellowMake sure of itI need orange earphonesNot yellow oneOkThanku
"Sound quality is good and build quality as well, I'm writing a review for almost after 6 months, and they're literally working good."
Good noise cancellation.It support ears . Sound quality is good too.
This is the best product. Works like a charm. Love it! 😊😊😊😊❤️😍😍🙏🙏🙏
Good quality product ...Best for low budget sound lovers in high volumeAs well as voice lovers for low volume.I ordered spirit lime colour unique and less chance to get stolen ..Soft bud holders.
That was a great earphone with good quality bass and it also keep a headphone cover back....
Noise canceling option not available
Sound quality was not goodPls refund money
"It just arrived & is a bit dysfunctional,now i m not goin to replace it rn but yeah me not happy"
I purchased it on 16 march 2021And on 12 april it stop workingSound is not coming properlyAnd customer care cut the call in the middle of talk 2 nd time this is happening with boat there all product is not they do only marketing
"Sound quality is very good.. Noise cancellation is not impressive.. But yes, overall a good product."
Just randomly order this because of my friends says.i used and it's performance incredible.now I loving it.sound quality excellent and bass is extraordinary.this is best for all your works especially gaming and movies.
What stands out for these bad boys is their sound quality and the packaging they came inn which makes u feel premium. The wire is also good and ear plugs are easy to fit.
"Excellent product,water resistant too,but the noise cancellation is too low, when we are on a moving bus,we would have to keep one hand on the earphone to hear it clearly"
Very worst experience..!! Duplicate product from this seller.. so try to order directly from the boat website..! Brought the headset before 1 and a half month only Now I can hear only from one side.. waste...!!
I bought in the month of December 2021. And right now it is just March 2022 and it stopped working.
"This earphone has stopped working,the outgoing voice does not work now after few months of uses only.good for listening music"
After 7 months of use one side speaker isn't working. Same like duplicate
The ear phone has stopped working even though all its parts are in good condition. Since its under warranty period kindly replace it .
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
 The headphones are good but the wire makes me disappointed because it has a small cut on joints maybe it'll create a problem in few days So I decided to replace it...👍
"It's a good product, but cannot be said as the best one. The thing that grips the earphones in the ears always gets out from the earphones, and that makes the experience very bad. REST, THE SOUND QUALITY IS VERY GOOD"
It's really nice... Just go for it... Good sound quality
Happy for same day delivery. Earphone quality is good. Bass quality is too good.  Overall satisfied
this earphones are so good sound quality is so awesome but not for high bass bass is average if you required more bass find some other
Pros:-- Impressive sound quality- Lightweight- Unique design- Got a good quality carry pouch.Cons:-- Extra large odd colour wire clip holder.- No noise cancellation
Purchased and returned the first time thinking it might be issue with the ones delivered.  Again ordered & found the same issue of cracking noise during call.
Pathetic. One speaker was not working. Had to return. Poor quality.
But is durability is not so longAnd this brand care services is not good
Hurts the ear. You wouldn't expect to wear headphones and crank the volume to full in a good pair of headphones. But I need to get it to full volume too hear the intricacies of good music.
Overall sound quality is very good and Bass quality is superb. The switch and mic part look bit fragile. Overall a very satisfactory product.
Seems like a fake bought the same one from flipkart was goodReally lacking bass ....previous one that i bought from flipkart was much better ....may be this seller is selling it fake now.Replaced item was the expected one
Good product in the price
I am using this headphn from past 3-4 years. And when ever my dog breaks one i get the same earphone again 😂 so go for it no hesitation.. Just wait for thr sale i got it for 399
Not a good product for a person who wants a good sound and looking for a good product from music perspective..Disappointed Boat!
I bought this at Rs 349 during sale. It is a very good product. Boat is a trusted brand for sound since many years. After using it for many days I found this product really good.
Nice earphones but not a extraordinary... crystal clear sound but not real basshead bass little bit decrease as compared to 225 overall in this amount earphones too good looking awesome sound overall awesome....built quality fair enough .
"Good product at the right price, comfortable to the ears and doesn’t slip"
Best value for money earphones. In fact u get more than what u pay for. Sound quality is pretty gud bass is gud earphones quality is gud. No competition in this price segment it's a clear winner. Jst go for it.
"Amazon is not interested in customer service Wrost product and amazon is not interested in customer services, since too long ordered replacement but nothing done by amazon"
"Last time I was using mi earphone , but when I listen boat sounds I am totally crazy .. really awesome earphone with in good budget ..we have not to pay more money for this like other headphones mi or realme .."
"Product quality is really good... added with punch of sound , volume button adds to user friendly requirement while on the Move its defiantly a good buy... hope it will last long as well thanks Amazon & Boat"
Value for money ..I promise to every buyer you will love it
Boat Bassheads 242 Lime : Quality of wire and other material is good. But after using 4 momths one side ear receiver is broken suddenly. Finding the replacement points the breakage is not included. But if cracked without accidently what to do ?
Good product at reasonable price.
"Good, Beautiful & Very Nice Product. I am happy and love this product.Sound Quality is Very Good.Wired design good plus water resistant product.Bass quality is very Nice.Overall Beautiful & Good product.I am Happy..😃😀"
"It's tough, durable and produces a very good sound quality."
Bass quality is so below average.
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
 The wire quality should be modified into thread quality and need more fined quality in sound. Overall I can prefer all to have a earphone like this ..
Not a good product... I bought it just 4 months back and facing sound quality issues. Need a replacement for this
Sound quality is awesome. Bass is also good. But after 30 minutes of listening songs feeling pain in ears. This is the only thing which is very bad of this earphone. Overall it's good product with affordable price.
Its really good with price tag.. Earlier I was using much expensive wireless era plugs but these are best.
Too much base which totally distorts sound at high level. Plastic used is cheap and has rough edges which pricks in ears. Opt for basshead 225 or Mi basic earphone(best at this price range)
Am using it since 2 months no complaints till now. It's so comfortable with rubber supporter and sounds amazing and mic is pretty gud this is best jogging earphones this won't come out until u pull it out. Coming to wire this is so long lasting. I recommend this suerly
These are excellent earphones. If we see comfortable then this is more than perfect but this has low bass . If you are buying this for online study or youtube videos than you should go for this.
Using since last few months..Sound quality is perfect. Awesome Bass and noise cancellation as expected from Boat. The quality of the earphones is too good .. the wires and mic are up to mark. Yeah it's splashproof too.
Thanks to the sporty look and fits great in ears. But not tangle free . Bass is too high
Left side not working properly
"Looks good sound is clear and loud but bass is not upto mark and I don't expect that from boat.. comfort in ears, sweatproof is OK but I don't think cable survive with sports activities.."
It stopped working after 8 months.All customer care numbers are wrong even email address is also wrongPlz do not buy.
Got some issues but after replacement the new pack is ok only issue is now i cannot order it again because after return two orders are counted so how to purchase new
"The bass quality is awesome.  The noise cancellation feature is quite well.Sound quality is also good.If you are here for this product, go for it."
If you want to buy budget earphone then you can go for it.
Fantastic headphones for the price.
The earphones are average to above average in terms of range but one thing which I can guarantee is they will work even after a nice wash in the washing machine 😂😂😂 thanks that was my review!
"Proper sound ,strong wire and nice &bright color, overall performance was good in reasonable price. Happy with the product."
"The bass is quite fine, but the sound quality is not so much, earlier I used realme buds 2 and it had a better sound quality as well as good blending of music with the bass but wasn't durable like this one."
Honestly the best earphones you can get for 500 rupees if I had to point a fault I guess it would be the fact that the wires too thin and feels like it would break easily if you're careless.
Build material is so poor. And there is no return and replacement. 7 days returne and replacement is mentioned in item details
The sound is very good and the quality is very good
No bass no sound qualityBass 😂😂like chutiya kaat diyaIts pain for ear if u protect your earI use for 2 h its for paining my had and not for gaming if u want for gaming so don't wast of ur money

"I write this review after the use of 3 month, when i bought the bass quality is good but after 15 days of use the bass wuality is automaticly reduce...., and one more thing after the use of 2 month the right side speaker does not working"
Oh well overall it's all good. Sound quality is just fine. Eartips are comfortable. The only downside is feel it would have been better if the cables were the flat one. Rest all is great.P.S mic works really good picking up all the noise
My brother suggested me to buy this he had been using boat headset for almost 2 years and it doesn't have any damage so I decided to buy it . So happy with the product we will get a pouch and extra buds with them✨
BHADHIYA HEADPHONE HAI KHUB KAAM KARO TO BHI KAAN ME SE BAHAR NAHI NIKLTERACE MAARTE PAR BHI BAHAR NAHI NIKALTE
Wire too thick. Not flexible
"Three month of use”No issue at all.I was surprise to get that cute sag with it! Because of that bag my earphone don’t get messy, easy to find also 😍"
"Stylish design, awesome sound quality the signature bass by boAt, + factor is it has volume buttons & play/pause button too."
Value for money...Sound is goodBuild quality is goodBass is goodVery comfortable in ear ...Kharid lo{Jai shree ram}
Sound is loud but no bass at all. Treable is more We can hear the sound outside.
Worst quality. Brought only for volume control keys but Quality is similar to that of 200 rupees cheap earphones. Can't even return. Disappointed. Better go for little higher JBL earphones.
Not comfortable.. avoid buying this handfree.. music z ok but Mike is not troublesome.. itz price should not be more thn 200 rs.. ordinary handfree.. disappointed..👎👎👎
"Worst headphn i have ever used... Mic is not working just within 15 days aftr i purchased also when i plugged in headphn, most of the time voice dosent come through headphn it just come out of the speaker... Connectivity issue ... Very dissatisfied with this boat headphone"
Really supper bass effect. Also best for gaming. You can easily understand from which side enemy is coming. Foot sounds are so so clear. Deep punching base. For music lovers and gamers. Review by me after one month.
"Hi am sravan i used sony headphone but within 1 year sound noise defect next JBL C100 But near headphone jack wire problem. finally, I bought boat 242 it has good in sound and easy to control sound, and most important cable it was strong finally its good for mobile, laptop and iPad"
Bass was amazing at the start. But it reduces gradually. produces uncomfortable sound at times. I'd recommend to go for another model.
Sound quality was okay. One side stopped working in a month. Return date also got over. Very disappointed.
Worst earphones ever I have used.Almost after a month the sound quality degrades and there is lots of trouble and disturbance in the sound.. I'm literally not satisfied with this product and I never suggest anyone to purchase this one..
"Superb earphones from Boat. Superb audio quality, clear vocals, bass is not very deep but sweet bass for improve music quality. This earphone is awesome in this budget, nice fitting with two extra pairs of earbuds. Overall I'll give 4.7/5."
I bought these on 3 July 2021 and they are non working now.....no sound at all very short lived please don't buy
"I like this earphones ,Voice is loud and clear because of 10 mm driver's wire quality is nice but not tangle free.This earphones is better than ant audio w56 according to me in Voice and in earbud quality."
"Design is superb,  build quality is good and it is even light in weight,  fit perfectly into earsWire quality is too good.Sound quality is superb,  deep bass,  clear audio experience."
Not suitable for all ear typesHaving ear pain after using for 20 to 30 mins.Apart from this everything is good.
Very good Quality headphones bass is very fantastic overall sound Quality is best.I recommend to all. Thanks boat
Sound quality is ok... but the wiring is pathetic. Headphones stopped working in 15 days. I have the warranty but do not know where to get them exchanged.
Great Purchase at Right Price
"Very good earphones 🎧 , best in this price segment , you won't disappoint but it is same as 90 rs ubon earphones 😂 still both are good we get warranty here 1 yr"
"Product worked for three months and one ear phone wend mute. Now every time i connect the earphones, even the slight movement of phone is disconnecting the call/earphone connection."
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
 Good ear phones good quality of sond I like this product very muchButIt's not working Iam not having ivoce what to do now how can I replace them
"I bought this item 3 days before , but today only it's mic got problem and it's automatically increasing and decreasing the volume and play the song and Cut and another end caller couldn't hear sound but only could hear some abnormal noise..."
"In Price of 599, It is a best earphone.I tried Mi dual driver,Boat Bassheads 225 & 172, Realme buds 2. Trust me, these earphone is nothing compared to the BoAt 242 in terms of sound."
"Writing this Review after using this product for 1 month+Product is good with excellent Bass, Noise Cancellation is working nicelyYou can buy this without any queries....."
"It will not work for even 1 year  like chines headphones  it will becomes 1  sided  in just months after you buy it , must go for alternatives  quality is too poor, brand name not garentee quality"
"Boat bassheads is fine....too loud, bass is not that good, subtle music is not there but overall ok ok"
"Vibrant colours, 4/5 noise cancellation, good bass and good sound. Second time Bought the same product (colour only changed). Build quality is 4/5."
"Worst product at this price. It is better to buy realme buds than buying this. The sound is not centred,that is,the left side is a bit louder than the right side and is irritating. And also sound quality is a disaster, don't fall for their false advertising."
Does not fix in the ear properly
After buying this product the plastic of earbuds just fall apart. The sound quality is average but the plastic material they are using is much poor than they are presenting. Was little disappointed
"Excellent quality and sharp sound, enjoy good songs."
"It's completely useless, waste of money, poor customer service"
"Amazing qualityLong term,  as a matter of fact this is the first earphone which has worked so long"
"I m not able to get clear audio,some times its clear some time audio get very slow.Sometime When i saw the any video its pick just background sound,its not pick the exact conversation between video."
1star less only as it becomes a little uncomfy after a while.
"Never disappointed by boat company it is one of the best musical devices in the world......anyways the earphone are very comfortable and sound quality is simply amazing,super and best!!!!"
Don't buy it ....very cheap quality... buttons dosent work....cheap quality wire.....dosent fit properly in 3.5 mm headphone jack .... it's not worth of ₹500.....if you want to buy good one....go for realme buds 2 in ₹599...
"This is not braided cable earphones ,please buy carefully only a few of them are braided like black and white lime"
Nice productBass is good and clear sound..Overall nice product....Must buy this product...
pros: sound quality is very goodcons: headphone jack has a very small and slippery grip
I liked this headphone very much I used so many boat and other headphones but i liked it much more that any other Headphone and in this price range you like don't even get ipx4 rating superior headphone
"The build quality of the earphones is not good and does not give a good feeling when you wear them. Sound quality is average but does find good bass with is contrary to the of the product ""Bassheads"""
"Bass quality is awesome 👌, except that, sound is mesmerizing! It can detect every bits of music; I cand hear every background besides vocals, it is able to identify every high and low pitch."
Worth the money u spend.. good sound quality
Very durableGood soundBass is not good in compare to realme buds 2Sounds pinch in earI had to remove that rubber material in earbuds to reducs the ear pain
"Look wise , quality wiseVery nice product.In terms of sound I am little disappointedVolume and bass not up to levels."
I’m giving review after using 6months without any damage just software corrupted like this earphones are doing .Sounds are automatically go and automatically go down continually.very bad product .
"Sound quality is nice, but because the bass is so heavy, the mids distort at max volume.Bass is mind blowing, so much that you won't feel the need tp reach max volume.Noise cancellation is pretty descent. Can not expect more at this reasonable price.Big thumbs up! Go for this!"
Better skip this one if you are an audiophile and can't do without sound clarity and bass because this one has none. The sound is unclear and there's zero bass.
Everything is good except the noise cancellation....music and bass is good and worth the money...
Good earphones for the priceNo issues after using for more than a year
Everything is very good.Best quality and looking nice.Totally 👌👌👌😊😊😊

" Perfect earphone ,value for money. Crystal clear sound ,level bass ,  comfortable for ear , and best quality wires. I liked it."
Doesn't meet the qualitative features mentioned in description
The earphones are budget friendly and has amazing bass! You'll can go for it!
"Product is good. I was used more than a month, but unfortunately cable got broken accidently. I feel cable can be more stronger"
This product is really bad and the purpose of those who are thinking of buying this product is to think once you have a problem before buying.Thank you all for giving me the time to read this statement.
"I purchased this product in Mar-21, at starting it was smooth but after 3-4 months the one side is not working. Raised complaint through customer care they asked me to send e-mail but no reply received till now."
Bass is so high treble is undershadowed
The best i've ever got... The earphones are incredible... Highly recommended... The sound is ultra clear and the bass is extremely loud.... Fully satisfied...
"Very short lifeWithin 3 months only, one of the earphone stopped giving sound(left one)"
Don't buy it after 15-20 days of use 1. Automatic Play Pause 2. Automatic Mute on call 3. Automatic voice increase and decrease
Boat is good product. But this item very worst I expected much more this item wired headphone  for bass it's too worst of it. Product was so thiner which I look for moment of purchase but I get a product some I didn't expect like this. Waste of money.
"A good choice in the normal price range . And good service support team  as , my previous same one which was damaged got repaired and replaced within the warranty time overcoming the Pandemic challenges"
"The audio is nice ,but for me the butt(I don't know what that thing to protect our ears are called) of the earphone was hurting my ear , but I changed to with my old earphones ear protection butts, and now it's pretty good"
"awesome really I enjoy listening to music, watching movies and talking with other  via this hear phones , looking very nice ,"
Pros -1. Amazing sound quality2. Brilliant noise cancellationCons -1. YOU CANNOT USE IT FOR LONG DURATION CONTINUOUSLY AS YOUR EARS WILL START HURTING
The sound quality is awesome loved the packing they also give a small pouch to keep the earphone there are extra ear plugs which you can change according to ur comfor. Will update a review after using for some time overall experience im happy for the product.
Item is good. But mic and volume control not working.. missed to return..
It is good. the sound quality is good and the microphone clarity is also good. The only thing is that the jack is very smooth and hence while plugging in or unplugging it it is a little difficult.
Sound quality and bass is excellent... But noise cancellation should be develop. Overalls it's good product in reasonable price.
Don't buy this one within 15days mike got issue when i send that back to amazon everything got changes they gave ear buds used one with lot's of waste in it recommend not to buy this if u want to use go for better one
"Best sound quality one can ever find in this range with active noise cancellation and a premium bass quality. And, it has a much more quicker response than the wireless earphones."
"According this price this is good product. Wire is good, ear drop smooth and comftebl without extra ear grip. Grip is best for ear and sound quality too good according price.Overall best thamb BOAT."
Good quality sound
Sound quality is very nice but no noise cancellation option in the earphone .Build quality is ok so I recommend buy this product
"Build Quality of this earphone is very good. Sound Quality is above Average, but I am not happy with Bass quality. If anyone is looking for bass heads then you should look for other product."
"It has 4 extra ear buds a free small bag  ,cable clip and secure fit ear hooks snd the wire is has anoyher layer of plastic coting which is very goodThe sound quality is also very nice you must buy it"
I ordered these in Prime sale for 399. Honestly they sound good for the price that they come at but the build quality is really delicate. You could break these easily and the wires don't seem long lasting either.
"Overall good,with osm sound quality and stylish designing and some what little problem with bass but it can be excepted.Awsome product for gamers without any sound lagging.Totally awesome"
"Holly crap , worst fit. This product will not fit in, its just holding up.  Sound quality is bad as hell. All those color variants and accessories are just gimmicks to hide its major problems. I totally regret buying this."
I liked the pouch and the clip given along with the earphone. The earphone is of good quality. The wires look sturdy and earhooks are comfortable.
Not worth 500. Audio quality is poor and causes pain when used for an extended period of time.
Wrost product I purchased don't buy boat headphones wastage of money. I waste my money. Its better to buy another company headphones rather than boat. I hate it won't like to give any star.
The right ear sound is not coming properly... It's coming with noise disturbance..... The QA has passed without checking.. I have ordered other Boat earphones earlier.. But they are very good.... Why this is faulty... You guys have degraded and lowered you standards.
"I liked it's style, it's built quality. I have the blue one, the colour combinations of the blue and black is great.Bass is totally fine. The treble is not that loud. Which I like the most. The sound is so satisfying😌."
Awesome sound quality Designed specially for music  lover
I loved it it's good except for vocals tested in iPad mini 5 note 9 pro samsung j7 max s10 lite and ideapad gaming 3 friend while in online chat over discord claims that audio was super clean so no problem in buying this
"This is awesome product. I have been using it since 5 months now not a single problem I had.Sound and build quality is great, bass is decent.If you are planning to buy go for it."
"Sound quality awasome, bass awasome ,budget friendly, overall very good"
Just buy the best and this is the best!
"Within 2 months only ear phones got damaged.no proper sound, not working while talking in phone , automatically volume increases.waste product."
Good in this range..You should try it out. Worth it.Sound is like OMGtribbles also mainted with baseOver baseAnd you can not hear in your full volume .10 mm drivers make it powerful💪

 All good 👍 but packaging is broken and boat bag is torn
"This brand I am using from last 3yrs, I like it. But this product is waste of money and the quality also very poor."
"Good quality product 👍 sound quality is very good, bass is perfect, best for gaming 😍😍"
"Sound quality,bass quality, noise cancellation everything is absolutely wonderful! Great deal and best product in a total package."
"these earphones are awesome. sound quality is better than JBL, JBL is expansive and mic is totally useless, this is my first Boat earphone. and they are worth a price."
"Worst earphone i ever purchased, 2 month only working after mic not working sound increasing & decreasing automatically, after some good reviews only i purchased these reviews are not real are all fake, finally a worst quality i received."
"Wire quality is good, sound, bass allthing is awesome but only voice button is not working.I don't want to replace or return this handsfree.Pls advice me if it other issue pls solve itAside BOAT TEAM"
If YOU looking for a budget earphones.....  Just go for it...BASS is so good even mids and lows are best in the segment....Just go for it... Much recommended 👍👍👍👍

" Liked product too much. Delivery was too fast (even I am non prime Member). I always used Boat Headphones, Bluetooth and Airdopes..I am just lovi'n it.....🤩🤩😍😍"
"You must take extremely good care of them, if you want them to last long. In this price range you don't get that much durability. Having said that, you'll face absolutely no sound issues."
Liked it in real more than a picture. It's quality is very good and also liked the part that they send a small velvet pouch for your earphones. Bass quality is also good.
The product is beast with best ..the ear piece looks awesome the boat design on the ears looks preety..great idea boat ..but the wire is thin as compared to different boat product..
Another earphone is working but this one's mic is not working in my phone bt in other phone its working and don't know why it is not working in my phone when my old earphone is working in my phone
Sound quality is not better than others.It's an old earphones I just bought because it had volume buttons.Bass is not so good.Noise cancellation is not so good. It irritates a lot.Sound quality is clear.
"Get a product whose mic is not working good from the first time, when a make a complaint to boat, they pick up the product from my home and give me a broken headphones. I use boat for last 2 years, but this time i suggest to not go for BOAT."
Sound is perfectBut a single point which is going to disappointed that is no magnetic interaction between left and right ear budsOverall good
Awesome product. Value for money. Certainly go for it.
this earphones are good for movies and songs and games also but not for PUBG  while playing my team mates are getting resound mike sensitivity is low my frnd also got same earphones and faced same issue
"Please Don't buy it, it's so uncomfortable with the ears, after wear more than 30minutes it will hurt your ears. I was always having problems with Boat earphones like they are not comfortable with the ears, please don't buy it🙏🏻"
Very good product ...go for it
"After using 4 days, I am writing this review.First of all, delivery is impressive. Got product in 24hrs. Sound quality and bass is too good at its price. Fits well in ear and have mini pocket which is useful in traveling. Overall product is too good. Thanks."
"Awesome Sound. Just listen the song ""Sach Keh Raha hai Deewana"" Madyam version. Awesome pitch and clarity is too Good. I have to say it's better than the Sony earphone that I used. Go for it.👍"
"It was very wonderful product , i also ordered two of them both worked great , best sound quality , and i even mis treated them they didn't go down because of the quality."
The most cool part is the colour and also the sound is like amzing and also its quite tight and fits well in my ears also having support and u can see the packaging was so cute.it is worth every penny .😍#mustbuy
"This earphone is really good at this price range.The build quality is so good,it fits really well in our ears,and the bass quality is best in class and yes it also comes with a pouch.So,go ahead and purchase it without having any second thought."
The earphones were of great quality. But its not sturdy enough. Broke within a few weeks of usage.
Good in this price. Not to be excited at all. You can't better than that at this price. Noise cancellation is good. I don't like the bass quality.
"There is a warranty on 1 year from date of purchase but I am not able to find any option that how to avail that facility, my earphone stop working within 65 days after delivery. Please help me"
"Buy it if you want a earphone for calling purpose , and little music during workout or Jogging.As per price ,It's perfect."
After 5 arround months you face this problem. One headphone not working. But you can found any service center nare. It's a major problem. Remember service center is very important.
"This headphone is neither very good nor bad according to the price, it does not fit the accordion of this price."
Hearing with this set for long time can have pain to ears....as I didn't found comfortable....sound quality is good  can be better
"Sound quality is good , bass is also nice but not so good. I think  this  handfree is best in this price 489. Noice cancellation is also  good but not the best.Now let's see how long it lasts....."
Bass quality is okay okay. Well is just need them to attend my online class so yaah they are useful for me. And yaah ofcourse I am not a music critic. But the rate is a little bit high as compared to the quality
Truly a steal at this price. Very comfortable. Bass is very good. Although can be better. But at this price one of the best earphones.
"I had purchased this product 2 months ago but from past 5 days speakers are not working,and I am not able to connect with the seller to claim my replacement as the product is in warranty period  really very sad"
It's review after some months. Best budget branded earphone. I think everyone can buy it and use it. Sound and base quality was good for this price.
Superr sound quality and really great bass sound effect. Loving this product and enjoying each beats & music. Price is Afforable too.
"Sound quality is goodBut bass is not to much and sounds are so crispy which is not feel like regular and best, you can go for another brand like JBL"
"Great product I had seen ever , sound quality is too good , wired quality also good , best thing is if you use this earphone out side voice don't disturb you... overall products is awesome , buy it and enjoy ..........."
Don't fall in trap with that wearied design. Its 100% uncomfortable even after removing the additional rubber around the ear phones. causing severe pain to the ear.
This is total value for money. The noise cancellation and fit it very good. Sound quality is also great. Very good deal
The earphone got damaged within a month of usage. There is no visible damage from outside but it doesn't function.Do not recommend buying.
Nice product with good base.But price can be reduced by 50 rsThen it will be a great product
Worst for Gaming (Especially Pubg) and good for listening music and call
an irritating noise similar to a radio sounds comes to the other person on a call..very loose socket
The sound quality is best in price range. Recommended for all. It's better to go for it rather than some cheap wireless stuffs.
It's a good product good quality . The sound is pretty good too. If you are looking something which has good bass you should not expect more from it. It's very reasonable for this price range.
The out put of the audio is tremendous and the bass out out is good and it does not give the full output of flac and 32 bit songs.but 24 bit songs are good to listen with this headphone.
Value for money earphones with good bass for the given price.
This a good one and works well for calls. The Mike is also near to the mouth so the other person is able to hear you properlyI would recommend this one
"Wow..What a product.. Excellent bass, treble.. Super comfort to the ears..and built quality is awesome.. Love it..👌👌👌"
I used these to record audio for my you tube channel. The sound quality was awesome. The clip given with it can easily be used to attach to your shirt and record sound.value for money.
This is the best earphone for this prize bass is awesome and sound quality is also good.
Does the work as advertised
Sound quality is good.  I like the color 😍. It has Sound inc/dec button. Totally i like this product.
No Good
"Not soothing to ears, its more of high pitch sound/noise. Treble is more and ratio between bass and treble is not there"
Its very good product for thw give price. I have been using more than 6 months and  its serving its purpose. Build quality is very good and sound is also good and loud.
"Initially it worked well, right microphone sound was little less, in next few weeks it got worse and not stopped working"
"A pack of joy,product is superb and I never expected the packaging to be superb. A special pouch to put the ear phones is a delight"
"Good but day by day performance gets little poor.... I mean not giving the exact performance, like when its received and used for few weeks...."
I like this headphone..Color is cool 👍
Bass is like a 50 rs earphone but fitting is good but I will not prefer because it's too expensive for only fitting
I have replace it two times and stiil it's one side is not working worst product
"One(left) side wasn't working well...now they aren't taking this back or any...but if uh are buying this,make sure to check them as soon as you recieve them..n return if feeling,go for it"
2 months bhi nhi chala kharab ho gya mat lena yeh wla bekar hai bahut jada paise waste . realme buds 2 lelo uska sab kuch sahi hai. Aur 1 year hone wla hai abhi tak khrb nhi hua koi problem nhi aai hai .
"best product you can get in this range of price... sound quality awesome, design awesome, qality awesome, colour choice awesome. this is best. don't think just buy🤟🤟"
Just wowwwwwww 😍 😍
"Really nice, sound quality and base is very good.But after 1 year of use, 1 side bud is not working."
"Great product.... i got it on deal price 399...In this price, they give volume control with great sound quality. ....must buy product"
"Great product, i bought it for 350 on new year sale, so for that price point its a deal breaker,Great sound ,great bass, great voice clarity. Been using this for about a month and no issues faced plus build quality is also great, no tangling or tearing up of wires"
Value for money product and 1 year warrantyBhot acah delivery ta amazon ka I like 👍
It's amazing product. Justifying the price and brand. Buy without any thought in your mind.
Like the esrbud quality  not harsh like previous boatheads
Best in this price range. Better than others.
I like the earphones but sometimes the music will effect in your ears ( chugna) And I thought that this earphone will be good for BGMI and all but no it's not good gaming...Btw I like the earphone colour design...
"When I connected headphones to mobile and laptop, sound is not coming. I verify with my other headphones and they are working very well"
Microphone quality is really really poor. You have to keep the microphone near your mouth while speaking in order to make your voice loud n clear. Thats the only issue I faced.
The volume control button don't work even after replacement. The only reason buying this overpriced earphone than 102 model is the volume control but that itself is not working
The build quality and sound quality are superb. The only negative is if you using for a long time means you will feel a little bit uncomfortable feel in-ear.
"The perfect wired headphones. Best fitt with clip and hooks. Due to that great fit they have accomodated a very powerfull base producer, just amazing👍"
Great value under 600. Amazing clarity and sweet bass. Amazing compatibility with Mi phones due to in built Mi music equaliser software.I use it for honor 6x. Works amazing.
Earphone is excellent working but it's pause/next track  button not working in some smartphone.
Good sound quality but it has fragile physical design. In the first day of its use it got broken. Have returned to the Amazon for the replacement. Been waiting for the replacement
"Quality is good only issue is the mike will damage faster than we think .sound effect is perfect ,but materials will damage fast I experienced twice .becouse I purchase twice"
"Lot of bass, sometimes vocals get muffled. Not compatible with Redmi phones. It is good for people who need bass."
This is really an amazing earphone 💯. Overall fitness is just so accurate .Sound quality is well appropriate . I mean overall rating I would give 5 stars !.I would suggest you to get it out if you're looking for a wired earphone.
Like a ordinary hand free which is equalent to local hand free. Nothing sound quality is not good. Only one thing looks good after one month of use that it looks durable.
Sound quality is good at this price range. But my product was a defective one. Earpiece were fine but the mic wasn't working. I received a product with already opened seal. Sellers must ensure about the quality of the products specially those which are of trusted brands.
I brought it but not use till Nov 2nd..I used two days but it's noise and not clear in sound ..waste of buying ... return date is expired...
"The product was damage & some parts are missing too, sound of the speaker are also not working properly ,so it's also verified  the please provide refund of this product.I provide product pics also of it"
Sound quality and bass quality are good and I bought it for only 449/-.It has a pouch to carry the earphones.I always prefer boat earphones.
"Bought 3 of these, great productSound quality is nice"
"Left ear bud stopped working within one month, but the product is excellent and bass quality is superb"
I just got this in December the sound quality was ok but womithin 3 months the left ear plug broke bad quality felt very cheap
Product is not good ...ears start paining after a hour
expectations are always made success with this brand simply go for it
Good audio ... good bass .. value for money
It's pretty nice headphones. Good for regular use.
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
 At this price... Its worth is excellent... Thank you team(boat) &(Amazon).... BoAt always impressive👍👍👍👍👍
Product sound quality is good but could be better still there is lack in build quality within 4 months the earphones filter (small circular part acting as voice filter) has come out what should I do as a customer
This cheap product is the top worst ear phone in this whole world. Don't get into the trap. Its sound is irritating to the core. Its a crap.
Very nice sound quality and bass very usefull for online class and listening your favourite song and when you are working and talking puting this head phone it not fall becaue of that the sound comes clear and your entertainment doesn't stop👌👌👌☺️
Very good product. Works fine. Sound quality is excellent. Durable.
The earphone worked fine for two months but now one of the earpeice is not working and i ordered it from amazon where it showed 6 months warranty but apparently my return window closed a long time ago .
Sound quality is excellent and crisp. Highs and lows are excellent you can enjoy every instrument.Noise cancellation ie excellent. It bass is also good but not have extra bass and that make earphone more better then boAt bassheads 225.
Very worst product. Within 4 days volume control and call button is not working. Please don't buy this. Didn't expect this from Amazon.
Volume of both sides are little bit different and the colour of earphone is removed directly without touching it and 1 side volume earphone is just gone after 2months of buying I will suggest to not buy this earphones
This is worst and sound quality is also bad .Wire connection is loose in this earphone
"Both volume works only for decreasing sound.Volume button aren't working good, sound quality is very good, everything you like in this earphone except it's volume button."
Its a awsm product..sund is more like destroyer....but mic is small and shortly difficult to talk in call...but earphone is mostly havok... it's just awsm.
The earphones do not get detected by the phone most of the times. It is not an issue with the phone as other earphones are working absolutely fine.
"Not worth it, mine got spoiled within 2 months, I'm not saying boat earphones are bad but they r many others better than this, under ₹500 earphones r not worth to buy, don't recommend this."
EXCELLENT PRODUCT . HIGH PERFORMANCE DEVICE.
Build and sound quality is good but there is low bass in this earphone.i have OPPO Mobile and it's not working left and right sound in OPPO Mobile.
Pathetic service by boat manufacturer they give us 1year warranty hence their contact number they are not contactable ans site link won't works Amazon kindly do something as i purchased product through you
If u want the bass and the clearity 😍😍then choose this one there is no compromise in sound quality one of the best earphone if u are a pubg player then choose this headphone u can clearly notify everything ossom earphone 😌😌
"It has perfect bass and clarity is too good at this price range. You can hear almost every rythm, beats and tuning of any song but build quality is worst."
The product has excellent sound quality and also remarkable noice cancellation. It has anacceptable bass quality.The product provides more than what you think at this price range..!!!
Best at its price.
Very good  product very nice base this earphone have but one minor issue is there in the high volume  your not so confertable but then also in very good in affordable price you will satisfied
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
 The product was working good for 1st month and now its not working  since morning...Ridiculous as a product i need return or an exchange...
This is the best earphones in this price range. Overall build quality and sound quality is just awesome. It has been a year since I'm using this earphones. Loved the product
"They are literally perfect and the interesting thing is you'll be getting one small mini Pouch , a stricker tittled "" #IAmA boathead "". I have order green color this product is really cool and worthy to the price you pay."
Boat is a best product and I am using it since couple of years without any issues
Sound is all over good.... Bass is average.... And noise cancellation is so nice..... Feeling no trouble to talking in the crowd... Or any type of chaos.... Good for handling... Built quality should be more better...
Worth buying its good.
"Product looks cheap for the price paid rs. 450otherwise, functioning well so far. no issues as such"
"I bought it for rs 531.Afetr 1 month of use ,my experience was good basically for bass lover u will ho for it bt at maximum ssound voice and bass disbalnance voice is not clear at maximum sound.wire quilty is impressive..it will not toggle easily."
"Worst product.. after 2 months of using.. some sound is coming like Hustle sound... Don't buy guys... This boat hear phones are becoming very dirty , this is second boat  ear phone I am seeing."
"Poor quality wires, no bass at all, poor quality sound. And most important my ear started paining after single day use of this headphones."
Product is not good. Sound quality is similar to 100 rupees headset. Don't waste your money on this..
"Got a wired one because I needed good sound quality in low budget. Beats, treble and voices all have been managed equally well. Overall decent performance. I am really liking it and been using it since last 2 months."
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
 Overall sounds quality is awesome 😎 I like this product very much and it's come with awesome carry pouch which I personally like it this product is worth buying
Boat is just 100% satisfied.Don't worry take a chance with it boat basshead 242.The bass is just professional.
I am a boAt products user
Super quality...super bass .. attractive colour...
"I love sound quality super bass and good passive noise cancellation .I ordered same earphone second time b/z in this price range i didn't find any earphone with this quality of sound ,bass and features also . Earphone pocket is small in size it should be in large in size ."
"Product is nice and awesome sound quality, buy it without any hesitation as you won't regret after hearing sound quality. Same as Sony earphone sound. I am happy after buying this earphone."
"Brilliant one....One thing can definitely be improved-sometimes it gets difficult to eject it from the port as there is no grip provided, specially when hands are not completely dry.Otherwise, its perfect one..."
"When using it for whats app calls or on online meeting platforms , I'm not able to hear n also other persons can't hear me.. malfunctioned.Disappointed"
Good product at good price..must buy if you don’t want to indulge in fancy things like neckband or airpods. Simply awsome.
Satisfied sound quality...
"I gifted it to my mom, she liked it very much,Sound quality is very good!"
"Lowest Bass heard in any modern headphones, too much treble pains ear easily, not good in this price range."
"I purchased this product because I had online lectures and the earphones I had earlier were not working properly, I ordered this and after 8 days I noticed that piece I had received is broken, it left ear piece is damaged"
"1) Has little more bass,overall sound quality is good.2) Ear clips are too small as compared to images shown.3) cable quality is good but has less width comparatively.4) Has average built quality,but fine at this cost."
These head phone is awesome to starting use after few days my mobile head phone socket has repairedBecause the head phone jack pitch diameter is too high it could problem to u r mobile carefullyJack means connective spot of head phoneMay b defective on jack
Sound quality is okay. Could have been better
I retired them just after they arivved they're very bad as the sound coming out of them is very poor . I would suggest you could buy these if you want to waste your money
Bass 2/5Sound quality 4/5Strong builtComfort 5/5Light weightEverything's just perfect but bass is so poor maybe because it's flat design.
"Hi...out of the two same product bought, one of them has stopped working, unable to hear voice during phone calls. Kindly refund."
"Worst product from amazon, i purchased it 1 month back and now there's no sound on the right one while in the left earphone there's a buzz sound while listening, i would definitely not recommend this product and also i want a replacement for the earphone i bought."
"Reminds me an hindi phrase: ""अभी इतने पैसे में इतनाच मिलेगा"" you'll get only this much with the money you've given."
I bought it for jogging.. and the mic with the volume buttons stopped working after 2 months..  the wires are also so stiff that it  disturbs the sound when it touches anything
"Buying this earphone is waste of money. It worked hardly for 2 month's after that with the rubber bud, the earphone was in pieces. I was listening to music all of a sudden it broke."
Nice working perfect and quality of sound is also good 👍
"This is my review after using the product for 3 months......It is a very good product . In this rate no company gives a ear phone with noise cancellation and this feature is really working and it is also having great bass and sound quality....Finally, good product with all features in cheap rate.."
Nice .good.worth for the money paid.highly satisfactory...
It's been 8 months I'm using this. It has same sound quality since day one. Nothing has been change. It's Waterproof. I would suggest everyone.
After opening the box the product looks good but there is some hearing problem with fittings. It doesn't set on the ear perfectly continuously it's falling from the ear and some time there is some hearing problem.
Length is too adequate or extra large irritating at times. Twice return for faulty keypads for volume control but only getting further damaged headphones only boat needs to review this.
"These earphones were great, very sturdy, good for rough use and earbuds gets stuck to your ear, can be little tiring on the ear after few hours of use. Great sound quality."
Very frankly I am telling you that if you are thinking that this handsfree will have great bass then I would say no…It doesn’t have that much bass...It has very moderate bass...Overall sound quality is good...For this price range it is good deal…
Build quality little bit good. Sound quality average. Noise cancellation average & Bass is little bit higher than normal. Suitable for sports activities.
Only one word for thisEXCELLENTGood for anything don't think before buying just go for it .... Worry not pubg will be awesome with this
Awesome noise cancellation..but be aware if you are walking on a road and wearing this earphone because of it's noise cancellation feature you will be unable to hear the bike n car sound that may lead to an accident..be careful
To waste money on local earphone one should try this one product if one is love wired earphone...at this price range in wired earphone this one is best in terms of all view point.Strongly recommend
Disappointed with the colour.. Colour is different comparing with Amazon displayed pictures.. and rest of the quality was awesome.. and bass is too good 😍Worth product 🤘🏻
Forward.. Reverse and pause button maje ir different.
Best in this price I m listening it from 2hrs every beat make me dance....Best headphone must purchaseIts bass is awesome and beats are too good best manufacturing...
This Earphone has Treble only and No Bass.🥲 Why...??? Why would you do that...??? Earphones without Bass...??? Am I supposed to listen to Treble only...??? Music with No Bass...???
Nice sound quality. Cost effective.
They are super comfy. Wire is too good and there is no chance to damage the wire because it coated with thick layer. And yass clip and boat pouch was unexpected which were also good. Overall nice product.
Review after 15 days of buying - sound quality  is best in this price segment wire length is enough and the packing is also appreciative giving 4 start after my experience.
It's mentioned in product 1 year warranty but they don't botber even after 15 days for manufacturing defect
its an simple. i would like recommended only if you are going on colour and  brand named  . has its totally waste of money . didn't fit my expectation
"This product worked only 4 months, one side got defective. However got a replacement by boat.Value for money"
"Sound quality very bad,bass very low, connecting not proper in every use"
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
 Very bad producti will suggest not to buy this. Earphones got damaged within 10 days of use.This pure waste of money it's qulity is very bad.
Pack was open and was sticked with paper and no carry pouch and cable clip received worst experience ever
After 10 days not working properly
Good at reasonable price
Highly satisfied from this model Love It. Sound and bass quality is too good. Go With It Guys..
Bahut ghatiya product hai 4 month mein hi one side sound aana band ho gaya koi bhi waranty wala contact nahi kar raha care mein call karne pe koi jawab nhi Maine ₹549 price mein liye
Just bought this product before two months. Disappointed with the cable quality. I admit that this one has the best audio quality. But one ear speaker is not working because of the worst cable!
"One side headset broken down itself after a month, use with more care but due to low quality one side earpiece broken now not able to use and not able to claim warranty in the lockdown"
"Noise cancellation is fine for an earphone, does not completely eliminate the noise but does well enough, bass is great and overall is worth the price."
"Build quality, Sound, Noise cancellation, Bass and experience with this earphone is good.."
The sound quality is okay but the built quality is pathetic. The connections are loose so there's static as soon as you take the product out of the package and connect it to your device.
Happy with the product. Good sound quality. If anyone looking for wired earphone then go for it.
Not happy with ear cuffs and quality that was expected. Thx
Good product and was worth the offer price.
"It is not best product of Boat, I have boat earphones earlier as well bit this is not worthy, it is not comfortable at all. It's competitors earphone are available in less price with best quality."
I was expected that its sound quality and bass would be good but there is not like that the sound has not clear and bass is like we buy Chinese earphone of 60 to 70 rupee on the railway  station..... ☹️☹️☹️
"I bought this product a year ago and again I bought this but what I bought currently, is not the same product by quality or by features. What I bought last year is far better than now. Boat has reduced their quality of products."
Worst product and there is no grip to attach to the device and sound quality is not good. I throw it 2nd day bad experience
"Sound quality is good , excellent bassWire quality is avg .But with this price range excellent deal"
Kharab eaifone diya h 20 din me hi cable me cracks hone lgi .. is trh ka saman de kr aap apne hi customer ko km kr rhe ..customer ko bekar bachi hui jo expire hone wali hoti h wo de rhe ho ... you r dispointed me
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
 A product value for money voice quality is nice according to its price  its the best in that range among all other company head phones with Mic
Very good
Mic and volume control are not working after 1-2 weeks and I don't have any option to return the product.
Please don't buy these earphones. Wastage of money. These earphones qualify for garbage and trash.Please go for JBL instead.
"1more piston sound quality is much more satisfactory. All Boat's research is into how the headphone looks and built quality, but has zero sound quality. Don't buy."
Nice quality earphones
I used it for 4-5 months they worked really well but it is not working now idk what happened the sound is not coming;  i prefer not to buy !
Sound quality is good but could be better but more than hour using I feel pain in ears build quality is superThey given a pouch useful for nothing could be little big for keeping earphones
Everything is perfect except the grip of the earphone which is made to insert in the ears. If u have to use it for long time will recommend not to buy this. Because your ears will pain after half an hour.
Excellent Build. soud Quality like a boss
After use of 3 month its sonds started cracking waist of money🤯🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬Its made of plastic not such good fitted better go for realme 2 earphones😔😔😔😔😔😔😪
Bassheads........ Bass is only in name.... Regret after buying it.... Build quality is good but in sound there is only trouble... I don't know how do they dare to name it as BASSHEADS...
"I think the sound quality was good, basically you could use a equalizer for better base in your phone but apart from that I can guarantee you for its durability cause' I've used it for at least 8 months......"
"Worst customer service, compared to other brands. 1year warranty is just for name sake. Forget to get a new product in case your product stops working within warranty period."
Noise cancellation is less but sound and bass are very much better.I will recommend you but the problem is after 6 months mic will stop working and if you complain to the company of boAt then the pickup boy will say it's fake. It happened with me in last month and I drop the claim.
"With in 1 week of use, one of the wire disconnected from joint. We went to service center and they said it won't cover under warranty. No use of 6 months warranty. Very less quality."
"Sound quality and noise cancelation somewhat batter, but main disappoint isIt work itself after plug in the phone (automatically mute, call hold, call end) randomly"
Sound quality for this rate is very good. Mic didn't work in the first piece I received but the replacement didn't have any problem. Fits snugly... good for running and other physical activities
They just demolish the productThe new lauch are wrostWrost volumeZero bass.Please dont buy.If you want to buy go forSprit limeThts best
Contacted costomer service for Resolution they askes to post postive comment and post to which I will be informed via what's aap but till date haven't received any such. Great job
Great offer... Availed... Nyc sounds
"Best quality of sound, light weight.Volume up/low, call connect/disconnect button."
"I really like the design, product quantity and sound quality.I am writing this review after using it so many days.Trust me go for it."
"Not value for money, you can not used long time .Infact use of one hour, ear pain problem.At the same price you can buy another company products like realme.."
"I liked the product, biggest concern for me before buying was if the wires are weak and could broke easily but it's of good quality and I like it, if I have to suggest, I'll suggest it's a good buy at 449/"
"Just used 4 months or it's one side voice lost with it's mic too, dont buy this one either no warrenty will work all fake, this brand is fake dont know why this is famous."
nice earphones. got 2 ear buds along with a small pouch. quality seems nice and good sound output
When I ordered it first piece was detected then I replaced it with new one but in a month that also started making troubles. Now they are useless for me according to price quality is not good
"boat bassheads 242 are great earphones .But if you want the same amount of sound and bass than you will also get this under ₹199 , but bassheads will give you a better  comfort and water resistance."
"Initial expressions were very nice, they had good sound quality, bass, and mic.But unfortunately, just like other earphones, they stopped working after 5 months, usage was moderate."
Cutting is good cable quality is also good.
The cable of the earphone is made of cheap quality.complete digester.
Good sound quality
Great Sound Quality for the Price. Beats some of the earphones priced twice as much
The sound is good and the price was reasonable.  I purchased it during the Diwali sale.
"Such a nice product. Sound quality is best. If u want to buy a good earphones with low budget, this is a best product to buy."
The product was nice sound quality is excellent and the bass quality could be improved by bass it should be little more but not given  boat can improve it fitting was very perfect packaging was also good overall I want to give 4 star out of 5
It hurts the ear while putting on and the packaging is pathetic also the white clip makes it look really weird and cheap please provide return options available
Sound quality is not good at all as it is expected from boat. Worst sound quality. Even the wire does not seem durable enough. The sound is shrill. It is unpleasant. This product should be banned.
The best wired bass heads you can get..🎼🎶🎵♥️
"Earphone quality is good, sound quality too but the pin connection is loose due to which the left earphone is not audible. Even after replacing old ones with new, same problem is there with the new ones as well."
"The bass is great, nosie cancellation is ok, sound quality is also quite good overall a good product in this budget price."
After using 1 month :Bad build quality. The product broke while usingAudio quality is best but they need to work on build quality. Very poor build quality 😔
Sound quality is not up to boat level not able to feel the baseNot sure if the seller is giving orignal boat product also it is causing pain in the ears after 1.5 hr of continue use
"The earphones broke just within a month. Even though it has a year warranty, the service center is far from my place. The microphone was not very good to begin with."
Good quality earphones.. Must Buy..!!
Meet my expectations. Sound quality also good.
Super bass and super volume. Like u have to listen it on 80- 90 volume and it should be enough. Bass is super good. And on top of it 1 year warranty makes it a complete package. Satisfied with boat. ❤️
Product is excellent but there was a hole in my package its looks like Delivery person tryin to see my Product…Thats Not a Good thing
Excellent fittingGood sound qualityUseful cable clipNice built qualityNice bassIPX4 waterproof1year warranty amazing!Useful pouch inside
Within 2 month left side unusable.I think it is not satisfied for meAs per 500 rs .Even customer care no of boat is invalid.Unable to call boat customer service.
I Like boAt Headphone but this is product 242 very bed quality Volume Control don't work & click to volume increase automatic volume decrease and play / pause button don't properly work .
A good product in reasonable price.
Poor quality product duplicate piece better not to buy
Very Bad ExperienceThis earphone with Samsung's phone is not suitableBecause this earphone seems to be disconnect from the phone again and again and listen to music so ok but calling to it the earphone is very inferior
"Can't wear it continues for 2hrs like if ur watching a movie or in a continuous meeting you ear will start to pain,No dought on sounds quality it's good.Bass is also good."

I purchased this product on 6th may....But after 12 days ...I can't hear from one side.....I called Amazon customer care.....they said boat customer service centre call u....But till they didnt call me....
"My headphones was working but the mic and paues, play button stop working after a week, waste to time and money. Don't buy this product and Amazon failed to return the replacement."
Left earphone stop working . I claim for replacement that boat didn't reply . I try many times but they didn't reply . My friend also felt same problem . All are detected . Don't buy . Buy at your own risk .
Good product.
"Worst product, chachan chachan voice like very cheap quality, don't buy this,  you will regret for sure if u place the order, I returned this after 2 days, worst earphones"
"Loved the earphones, worth every penny.. And thank you so much for the cute little pouch., we can keep the earphones in it. It also holds a clip attached, very useful. Loved it."
Good at low price.
Very disappointing..I requested to return the same day I purchaged... tried to talk with customer support.. They were saying it'll be done very soon... But never done... Wasted my 548 I guess...
When I get this this is fine after playing 2 days PUBG my headphone's one side is crash and I waited 1 week for replacement but now this is working finely and this is very good product in cheap price.
I first bought this product on amazon and with in 2 days left piece got damaged. Again i replaced with new one from amazon and in one month whole product isn't working.
Decent sound qualitySound balance level is very goodBass quality always goodCable quality it's much betterVolume control working goodOverall I love it
"All over earphone sound quality,build quality and bass is very good.that easily fit in ear so you can use in gym and during running but mic quality not too much better."
Very low quality sounds. If you want listen in full volume it somehow hurts your ear. Rest look and bass is good . But main thing is sound and that what it lags in.
It is really cute to see and my daughter liked it.  It is really good for noise cancellation. I liked the sound quality really much
According to me and for me it's turn out the great productBecause ofWeight is lightThe sound clearity is remain good in Full volumeBass is greatPerfect fitOver all it's turn out grt one for me
"After using 10 month,its working fine.Earphone quality is good . Even working after 1 hour in water.But mic was not working after 3 month since purchase."
"Whenever I recorded voice using this, it was not good whereas got better recordings with other earphones."
Firstly boat is an Indian company and the sound provided by these bassheads is amazing. In songs where you think no bass is present but in these you can hear their bass. It is best than realme and redmi buds. I highly recommend it to everyone
The volume control buttons were not working so I went for a replacement but the replaced earphone has the same issue. It's frustrating.Either it's volume controls are fake or it's a fake product.Never buy it.
Very good item. Clear sound
Right speaker stopped working within 2 months of purchase.
Amazing product as always by boat.Fast shipping by amazon .Quality product best in 500 range.
It was an amazing product of Boat with this cheap price Sound quality was awesome and Cristal clear with wondolerfull bass. it has mic and volume control option and wire was laminated .
"Bought the product at Freedom Sale but within 10 days Mic is not working. Now, I can't replace it also."
"Liked the product. Sound quality is praiseworthy. Perfectly fitting to the ear and does not slip out. I use it while going for a walk and enjoy, sportify.  Thanks to boat."
Overall voice quality is very good. But in earphones there is no markings to wear which earphone to which ear like Left and Right ear markings. Other things are excellent. Little costly but quality vise good
1st one is not good. But the replacement one is really nice.
A good purchase but recieved a unpacked item through I returned for the same reason. Still accepted as is good in terms of quality.
I bought it during offers. It is worth more than what I paid. nice product... love it!
Both look and sound quality is awesome 👌
Used it for almost like a month and found it completely satisfying.High quality bass and medium treble rate. When bass is in high mode ears will be vibrating. Good voice quality during calls and online classes.
"I used that earphone but one side of the earphone not working properly thats why I request for the replacement of the product ,not refund .....if I want refund then why I purchased the product ..... replaced the product as soon as possible ... request"
Ausome
"Fits really snug in my ear, it's definitely not going to slip out during a workout. Love how it's very trendy and gives great sound quality for the price!"
Within 4 days I faced a problem in this.automatically the volume decreases...the buttons were also not working properly...
"Excellent product,the sound quality is damn good. I love it. The music is best compare to any other product."
"Sound quality is awful, too bad"
Great quality earphone build and sound quality for this price
"Overall good for listening music but mic quality nit good enough. Not much valuable if for office use, meetings as much is not very clear/low voice."
"Sound quality is very well, but one thing, after 2 months use depect comes in right side earphoi with low sound, Left side is high & other side is low sound I heard.."
Pure magic. Don't hesitate to spend on this.
Value for money product. I highly recommend.
Very best bass quality and best noise cancellationMic quality is also very goodMust buy this
"Don't buy this,  not working  after one running"
Bahut kharab earphon hai sound to achha hai but call pr bat nahi hota hai isse iska jack kharab hai
Bass audio starts cracking above 60% volume. Pretty good noise cancellation during calls with my samsung m31. An average earphone but good quality build.
Good for only music and for the people who love extra bass. Don't expect it to use for calls.As it is difficult to hear the voice clearly with extra bass.
I really like these earphones......I am writing this review after using it for one month....I am using these earphones while running also and i am happy to said that these are very good
Best Earphone under 500 Rs.Sound 5/5Bass 5/5Noise cancellation 4/5
Ear pains on longer period of usage. coz the plastic body kindof streches the outer part of the ear hole.
Not that good...I was using some MI earphones before this... at same price range I.e 500rs but those were better than this one... this is loud but not that clear and bass is also not satisfactory
"Sorry to say, but, I have received a damaged earplug..."
"Just in one two become faulty, one side sound is not coming.Boatbis also not providing door to door support we need to go to service center which is quite frustating and time waisting."
Sound quality is good highs and lows are awesome but the product quality is not that good the within 4 months the sound from the right side stoped working very disappointed
Within 2months the sound quality degraded.I don't know whether they are providing geniune product or not but I have got very bad experience.And when I am trying to call customer care of boat they are not lifting the call.
Gives constant static in realme 6 and one side doesn't works properly if wire is held in the same position for long like while gaming I got it replaced but the problem occured again and now I've returned it
Why boat gives a defective productVolume buttons and play pause buttons are not working at allSame defect on the replaced product...also .... very disappointing
Its a good product.. cable length is good so it is comfortable to place the device in pocket and listen also the earphone design makes it very convinent.. sound quality is good and noise cancellation is pretty good also. Overall a satisfactory product.
These earphones will hurt if you would wear them for long. The sound quality is loud but the bass is really bad. Did not meet my expectations.
"This product is not working goodWe have some issue in this productSound, calling, and other problem in this product.i have required to u please change my productBecause we have one year warranty"
"Good earphone, bass is not that great, but overall sound quality & build quality is great.If you don't care about bass that much (Like me) go for it."
It is a nice headphone the only thing i disliked was that the fullest volume was not that loud as in JBL headphones in same price tag.
"Dislike only ,It's not up to  expected ..Item is not good as seen it has bad quality of sound not comfortable to listen it is not fit to the ears waste of money and ,overall it's not a good product"
A must read review:Low BassHigh tangling issueThin voiceButNice designAnd original productComes with good looking pouch
Nice but got defective piece first. Then got replacement item which works fine.
This is best earphones i bought. Sound quality is awesome. Beats inside hard.
"Good product, Boats is one of my favourite company for earphones.Bass quality could have been better.Overall a good option of you are looking for affordable earphones for daily usage"
1st day review. Great product. Good sound quality. Good for this price range.Delivered on time.
"Fits perfectly in ears ,but must be kept clean due light colour,sound quality is amazing noise cancellation you cant hear any noises at full volume works perfectly even after 2 months"
This is a very low rated earphone if we talk using it a normal sound of other person make it louder to hear and irritates me also same case while listening music
It didnt suit mt mi note 5pro... Everytime i hav adjust this according to sound quality
"I bought this product just in nov 2021, its just 2months and one of the side has no sound... Didnt expect this from boat products"
The earphone provides very good convenience. But after sometime my earphone one side is not working good.Then I'll replace.Bass quality though to say but enough.More comfortable after wearing.
"Good for you if it fits. So in case having issues with similar design ear phones, give it a pass and choose simple in ear ones. If it fits,quality is really good."
Overall quality is best so far but the product material quality is not up to the mark . It's fragile so u have to take extra care about handling it
"""Cable quality"" is too poor it'll break very soon this cable is not like boAt 225 it was very durable but this one is not good at allBASS is not good As compared to my last purchase (boAt 225) it's not worth it sound quality is so so"
"The song quality is very good, the colour is also attractive,  but those horn like projections cause pain in outer ears when worn for slightly long duration"
Sound quality is excellent and built quality is also good i am writing review after 6 month of use by it .
I purchase this product for ₹499 but im not satisfied with the product quality the sound is not upto the mark i must not recomend any one to buy this version sound quality was not good and no bass at all
Its a good earphone but only issue is that it hearts your ear. when you use it for more than 1 hour your ear starts to pain boat should've done something about the comfort.
The quality is fine. But it is not that comfortable if u wear it for like an hour.
i didnt expect so high quality sound from it but the bass is too low i have to use some apps to increase the bass
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
 Good buy .... FREE mind all tym favourite earphone...
"The service is good I got replacement as a new one, After purchasing from 8 months one side is not worked, I put a warranty request so fast response. Thank you team."
"Super and sound quality is awesome ande so userfreindly to use ande it can fit to all devices it has superb warranty and you can buy it so cheap cost and it has discount ,so pls buy it"
"Best powerful earphones you can get at tthis price point, using this model from 3 years and whenever I want to get earphones I blindly buy it"
While listening to music or talking some kind of annoying voice is coming from both the ear buds. My both the experience from boat have been disappointed. Go for some other brand.
Nice Headphones And Bass quality super nice feel bass and no sound delay. And pubg gaming use this headphones❤️ no delay sound. Proper work order now no issue this headphones I love this headphones.
Hello Bhai  अगर खरीदना चाहता है तो खरीद लेमैंने एक स्टार इसे इस लिए दिया ताकि  तुम ये मेसेज पढ़ सको  pr bhai  5 ⭐  rate hai iskeSoch matt lele bas
earphones are too bad.. dont buy ... replaced it once yet same quality
"Sound quality is really good. Please prefer best streaming quality, you won't feel aby distortion at highest volume.. build quality is ok or good. Bass is superb"
"Very much disappointed, the headset takes several attempts of plugin in and out to just connect, mic doesn't function properly. Cannot answer watsapp calls. Waste of money."
Totally fabulous...love it 😌...the bass is mind blowing and so is the quality.
Good
Good at everything but right earpiece stopped working after few months. Price and performance are good.
Sound Quality is GoodNoise Cancellation is not goodBass Quality is averageOverall it’s okay for regular users. I am using it for E learnings and meetings
It has good sound and bass and also looks good.
"Got it for ₹399, its worth every penny. Just go for it if price is below ₹499. Sound quality is good. Bass is perfect. Its so light weight and it doesn't drop from your ears."
A value for money product. Comfortable to use and convenient. Assisted by soft hook the buds sit well in the ear. Recommended.
One ear is not working and i report complain but they're not responding.. I called customer care of Boat Company but still they're not responding
"Nice headphones at this price range, got the set for ₹349, in the start they were uncomfortable to wear but later they have fit perfectly, overall good buy"
Bass quality not so good wondering how it got nice rating
"The most impressive part of the earphone is the fitting in your ears, it holds in your ears even when you are running.... Noise cancellation is not good, improvement required...Bass quality is average but in this price range its a good one to buy"
It literally starting static noise on second day but I thought I was a glitch of my phone but after 1 month it totally stopped working totally worth product it's mic also is of bad quality don't buy
Great bass.it has a good fitting in your 👂.it is plastic built-in but it is good.as  plustic build it has light weight which give me a great pleasure.Mic is soo good .noise cancellation is desent in this price segment.
"For the price of ₹499, this is quite good product. Definitely not perfect, but nice."
Disappointed ☹️Sound quality is at new condition but I regularly used used after 2 months lest side sound is higher then right side and now right side is totally not working
I'm facing mic issues in my earphone nd i have visited boat service center more than 5 time no stock's no real location on map no calls response worst experience ever. Rest earphone is good
Initially I thought that I got damaged with bad sound quality later I have replacing I found that this product just worst in boat
A state of the art technology at affordable price.The clarity of calls is crystal clear.Bass and treble are well adjusted.. A worthy buy..
Very nice earphone sound bass is perfect
yes ...itz gud...mic was clear and the comfortness of the earbuds in ear is pretty much ok...i am using this headset in the last 4months...no issues found...not much bass ..but clear audio luvrs can buy it....
Very Beautiful Sound & Brass Quality.Noise Cancellation Very Good. Product Best
Lots of static noise.Bought in August and now in Januaary the earphones have completely given up.
"Guyz, I bought within one month Mic 🎤 doesn't work, Thus I claimed warranty and another headset i got. But even though I order Red, now i have black colour. Really i disappointed"
"It does not fit in the ear properly, the support is very little and it is rubber which is bent a bit which lets it slip."
"if you use windows pc. go to speaker / headphone properties, then enhancement, tick headphone virtualization and loundness equalization.  MUCH BETTER EXPERIENCE than normal. otherwise product is fine. you get what you pay."
Bass quality superb and build quality good sound quality is not bad but small uncomfortable with ear strips except verything ok Nice earphones in this price segment
"dont go for these. you will get this quality of sound with 80rs local chinese made ear phones. NO BASS AT ALL. idk, why people mentioned in reviews saying it has superb bass which is not at all there with the item."
Great product. Only ear buds are not up to the mark. I have replace it with my used ones.
Verry good product using it From more than 2 months and it is amazing according to its price.
Sound quality at this price range is best-5/5Bass-4/5Bulid quality-5/5No issues till now.Go for it. 😊👍
"boAt is emerging as a shinning star in the sound universe, brought it for a good friend and she loves it like nothing else."
"Product have all quality features as promised, but just one thing resist me to give 5 star is it's comfort-ness. The angular hooks are not comforting ears when used for long time also big design of peice that goes inside ear is sometimes problematic."
A long lasting product depending on the usage. I love the sound and noice cancellation. Just one drawback it has has is that the ear buds covering wears off easily.
The product is good. The only problem it doesn't work with Samsung A7 tablet. Rest is good. 👍
Boat is always best .  So do not think if you buy boat earphone .
As expected. Sound quality is really good
Liked
Sounds okayish. Can be used as secondary earphones for emergency use
Perfect one for those who wants to have with wired and budgeted.
Look wise the model is attractive but compatibility issue. In my case volume button is working but there was no sound in the earpiece. Boat Company should look into this issue and do the needful.
"The reason I selected the boat earphones is that, I am getting easy button controls at this price range. But, unfortunately they are not supporting button controls for my Nokia 4.2 phone..."
"The audio quality is excellent. The ear hook helps secure the earphone in place. Do note that wearing ear hook is a bit uncomfortable. So, wear it only when working out(when ear hook is crucial to secure the earbuds)."
Nice product
"If you're looking for a best economical earphones with high bass, then go for it without a second thought. It'll meet your expectation"
Listening music and gaming its a allrounder earphones best quality wire and it comes with pouch to carry outside
"Better than any other earphones at this price point. Using it from last two or three months, comfortable, good sound quality all are good"
"Best earphone in this range must buy , best sound quality , bass ,noise cancellation . Boat is a  best brand for earphones and speakers ."
"Not good,voice is pricky,could have been better,waste of money this model,please go for other boat models don't prefer this one"
Noise cancellation was not working. However sound quality is excellent
As always. Vow. Too good.
"Good bass and all but when taking calls, all the callers are complaining that they could hear their own voice like an echo. I bought 2 sets of earphones and both of them are having same issue."
It's been a monthMeetings - good one for long callsMusic - nice qualityBuild : perfect to earsOnly con i observed  wire is thin
Bass and sound quality is really good. Also It's built quality and design is really better than other earphone in market under rs 500.So if you need a earphone grab it.
Trust me it is way better than any other in the range of 3000 rupee range.This earphone is best in quality also.
Better buy something cheap.  Didn't last for even 5 minths
"Although there are many earphones available in this price segment, if it is not the best then it is not bad either.As per my opinion you can just buy it, u will love it."
Affordable and trust worthy earphone. Everything is good about it but one thing that the making team should make the size of the buds bigger as compare to now...
Superb one
It's a complete earphone awesome to use
At this price.. This is superb product I would say. Voice quality is very nice plus bass is adequate. It is best for beginners.
"The sound clearity is just so clear and the bass is really good, it literally thumps and vibrates the ear. Even the treble and bass highs, mids and specially the lows."
"Its a wow..Very good sound quality..You can enjoy every beat through this headphone.Wire length is good,and build quality is also very good..I wanted the wired headphone,so I order this one,and I am wo happy with the quality..You can just go for it.."
The Bass is good. Other than that it is not a great headphone. I got it on big billion day. So no complaints.
"Poor noise cancellation,too harsh for ear, not valuable for money."
Superb sound quality and bass also very good 👍...Skype calls also working fine
"I'm used may be one month sound is soo good, but over bass some times I feel, head set inline Mike is awesome, better quality metal design.......good product thank you Amazon gor safe delivery"
"In this price range, it's best product on behalf of:Sound quality wise,Build quality wise,And value for money wise."
"I liked the grip which the earphone provides for the ear. Also, the sound quality is excellent. And the braided cable wire makes me love the earphones even more."
Good
I'm writing review after using this product for around one month it is an good deal for 500 bass quality is decent. A well balanced product
"used on mi A1 sound quality is good just not supporting samsung f41, sometimes getting disconnected and volume /play pause controller is not working at all, was looking for refund or replacement but didnt found any option."
Colour mentioned is orange but I got yellow. Voice is not clear and full of noise. Cable is not of good quality. Plugins are of poor quality. Pouch is not useful . Overall the product is bad.
Nice thing a good product that fits perfectly in the ear
Sound quality is good but lack of bass quality....
Great quality for the affordable price. Plug in jack was bit longer than a usual one. Sound quality and bass effects was great.
"Bass quality is worst ,sound quality is average desige of the product is poor because after 1 hours it will irritate and pain started due to speaker outer body you can only use one hour"
Sound quality at this price is good
"Very bad product with in month , both side earphones is not working .boat brand is very bad and this is my 2 and purchaseAnd boat customer service is also very bad"
"Sound is good, bass is very good, looks stylish but not comfortable, it hurts in ear after half an hour of use, if you want to use for a long time then I would not suggest to purchase otherwise you can go for it."
"Sound quality is not good, ears start to paining after 20 mins, did't cancel unnecessary sounds and its create own unnecessary voice too, audio recording quality is worse ."
the build quality is not upto the mark. noone ask them to avail it in budget price range and then make compromise with the quality. wire cover started to show cracks within one month of fair use.
"Not satisfied with this product, like boat quality I was use another bot model but bassheads is not like thos quality sound like bass and others thinks is nice like spirite lite colour and Amazon delivery"
It's just an average earphone. The sound clarity isn't that great. There are better earphones available at this price.
I used this for continues 9 hours of callingAnd the microphone works excellent the sound quality is supper 😍 loved the base also best headphones to play pubg 💓✌🏻
"Very good product, I could say its length can be shorten. It's Mike is to low and overall length is not needed."
Thess ear phones are not upto the mark i purchased 3 in quantity & gidted to my cousin but quality is poor out of 3 earphone 1 is not at all working properly lot of voice disturbances are there & quality is poor .
"This product is worth it u can buy this, 5 star rating because of fit in ear, it is way much comfortable, awesome sound quality, better noise cancellation and its bass omg. I will totally recommend this earphones for sports use"
"The base quality is good, cancels all the surrounding noise."
Nice sound.Good passive noise cancelation.Good bass.The carry pouch is a good accessory.Nice service by amazon.Overall a terrific purchase  and completely value for money.
Best sound quality and very comfortable to wear in ears no discomfort everything is fine and I have got a warrenty card of 1 year also and ya you should also go for it.
Within four months of usage I'm getting sound issue. Extremely disappointed not expecting it from Boat..
I reported the problem and the delivery guy picked upThen no response from any response from anyoneAm still contacting the company it's better not to buy this
"Gyus don't buy this headphone. After buying this headphone I am hardly getting chance to use it. My wife, mother and brother whenever they get a chance they just take this headphone and vanished."
@499 it’s good deal. I’ve ordered it to gift someone who loved it very much.
मेरा एरफोन 6 month ठीक चला फिर अचानक काल पर बात करते टाइम सामने वाले को मेरी आवाज ही नही सुनाई दे रही हैं ।बेकार प्रोडक्ट हैं और boat कंपनी में वाररंटी भी क्लेम नही हो रहा हैं ।।।
"The sound quality was not good,not worthy for the price"
Earphones are looking good and sound quality is also GooD.But the main problem is after 1Hr it starts paining in ears.
Can't believe m sayin this but this one's actually better than JBL . Sound quality is above average noise cancellation is pretty good ..just wish the bass was better or if I could reduce the sharpness of it all.
"After 6 month Such an amazinggg product from the side of BOAT.. built quality, Sound effects, bass effects and style ...worthable for price such a nice budjet Headphone."
It max last for like 5months not durable. Noise cancellation is not good at all the bass quality is 4/5 pretty good and the sound is average I'll rate this headset a 2/5
A perfect combination of bass and treble..a must buy..stylish and quality brilliant.
"Product Design Fits Perfectly in the ears.. Good sound quality, Noise cancellation n Bass Quality.. Reasonably priced.."
I am Giving this Review After Using This Earphone For 15 DaysI bought this Earphone in 449/-Best Sound Quality Sound Bass Everything is Perfect But at last  its with Wired So We have to Take Care Everytime....5/5 Star
Not comfortable as expected. Sound is good. Design is durable. Water resistance at it's best.
One of the best and affordable earphones everyone should go for it instead of going for an other band.
i like the pouch they have so plus point for that and the sound got disturbed on 80 to 100 percent volume.  So I personally like this because i am not a music lover i have bought this for a decent purpose .
Great value for the price. Good bass.
Sound quality is audible. Cable length is to long
Not satisfied with sound and in-ear comfort..
"Best Earphones at this particular price. Excellent sound quality, good material used is wiring and buttons and pods. It doesn't fall while running, fully comfortable."
I naturally listen high bass songs. And this works perfectly. I like this earphones.
"Amazing product, sound quality is just Excellent.. Fits perfectly in ur ears, I just loved them.. 🙌I ordered them yesterday and today they have arrived... Thank you amazon for providing such a good service"
Sound and basa quality is really good but the only problem is that if you are using it for long time your ears will start paining as it is not able to provide that comfort.
All is goodsound top notch 😊Vocals is top notch🤩Music details not bad 🙂Looks like premium quality 😍Wire is too Bad 😔
Within 20 days of purchase right side speaker not working. Not fit in ear and cause ear pain. You can use same for some short period.DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT
"Sound is good, build is okayy, fits perfectly in my ear. The only issue I find is the jack. It would better is the jack was L shaped"
I like the sound quality .. bUt i dislike the mic quality .. the mic catches very little sound ... That get me angry all time ... Its mic is not good . Unsatisfied by the mic 😑
"Earphone is good....price worthy and specially i like its colour.Sound, bass everything is good."
Review is very small word for boAt and not required.
Nice earphonesGood sound qualityEar fit and comfortableBut the wire looks cheap but it of good qualityIf ur budget is a bit higher then go for boat bassheads 300 the flat wire one
It's just break within 6 month of use.... And warranty apply Toh.. They said.. Ki physical damage pe warranty apply ni hoti... Jabki damage khud hua due to poor quality..
Nice Product good working
"Its not compatible with Realme phones, its sound  good in other phones but but am not satisfied with the sound and bass whenever i used it in Realme phones... So its a disappointed deal..."
Decent earphones for 400 bucks won't recommend buying this. If you can extend your budget then please go for realme buds 2 it's superior than these in every aspect. Thank you:)
"It's really a great buy, the built, sound and looks are all amazing. Bass is also very nice and call quality is also impressive. Go for it.."

Best earphones at cheaper rates.... Sound quality is excellent but I'm bit disappointed from the bass quality although it has more than average bass...Good ear fiting.....And overall results for this product is more than satisfaction
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
 sound and bass  are good but built quality is not good its 3.5 mm jack broke while i accidentally drop my cell ... worthless do not buy it..
When the time not playing any song or video on the phn it it's gives sound like queeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeSo irritating that to meOtherwise all good
Sound quality is ok
Wonderful earphone in this price with good bass & loud sound quality.  Go for it
Earphone is awesome.... But there is no pouch and extra eartips in the box...
Good product in this price range

"Best built quality at this cost with clear sound and mic use, using for Kids online schooling and work from home it's perfect."
I like it
Fits very well in the ear
I have used lots of earphones from boat and other same price range brands. This one has everything as balanced and good sound quality too!
I don't like the item 😝😝😝🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮after 10 day is problem left speaker
"Sound quality Is Very Good, Bass is also Perfect not overpowered bass and it will not give u headache after Long period of listening. Very good noise cancellation. Over-all A very Good Product In this Budget Price  segment."
Ok Product not worth the money
Sound quality was very poor. High volume giving distortion. Not pleasant.
"Worth buying at this price, but only if you love bass music, because non-bass music lacks power and sounds artificial, whereas bass songs simply rock."
Great to hear this quality of sound from this much budget friendly earphones and experience is great to be honest🔊👍👍👍❤️❤️😍
Ear pains after using 3-4 hours except this it's the best you can get in 400
left earphone stopped working after 1 month and also This earphone pains badly because of that rubber and if we we will remove that rubber the look of earphone will be bad
"Superb pair of Music buddy, Beyond Expectations !"
"As per my opinion,sound quality is average.noise cancellation not so good.ear hook causing pain in my ear.returned it."
"Super bass, great sound quality, best for gaming experience. It's a great earphone in this price segment."
Nice productHappy with the qualityGreat value for money
Using it from last 2 months... the build quality is cheap... the mic is damaged... if you try to talk on phone while the phone is in pocket... the mic stops working...
As expected
Not a good product. Exactly after 7 months. Hearing issue. Only one side audible. Cable got cut after 2.5 days. Customer care number s not working. No service.
Only one ear piece was working and that too with too much noise
"Feel is good, treble is average, bass is superb, mic works fine. If you can ignore treble soundits one of the best earphone in budget."
Good quality stuff! Beautiful colour! Go for it 👍🏻!
I liked it but it has stopped working only after few months.
g p
"Sound quality is really nice and it's too loud and almost impossible to hear music on full volume.....very nice sound quality for games like pubg as you can trace the footsteps, fire sounds, etc."
"I got good one from amazon., low cost with extreme quality Nd also flexy., provided extra buds and a year warrenty card., after that I order a laptop bag recently so eagerly waiting to receive and I will definitely review on it.."
Wire quality is good but microphone is stopped working after 1 week to raise Complete with boat this product not available in boat products list.Please don't purchase this product.
"I like its sound quality but very poor built quality it not fixes in ear easily , can not fix in ear easily so not good product to purchase"
Superb quality loved it
"I Have bought 3 of these ear phones.. I face problem with jack, and after a couple of months of usage, only one of the sides of the earphones works... and I didn't get proper customer support as well."
The earphones are good but it pains near ears after using it.
Over all a good hands free in very minimal budget.
"The worst quality expected by boat , the earphones came in broken but just fixed enough for breaking with one time use , so don't even waste your money , just buy some other product"
--> Great Sound quality.--> Light in weight.--> Excellent product go for it without a doubt
"Bad package from Amazon.I could find mud in those boxes as well in the the Earphone box,such a lethargic packing.But the earphone is ok for this price range."
"Descent sound quality, good for musicClear and crisp music"
"They'll hurt your ears. Further, built up quality is cheap. The sound quality, bass is better than fine. Major issue is that they are not at all comfortable with cheap aesthetics."
Nice head phone sound quality was osome nice 🙂 ii am happy eith this thanck u Amazon
would recommend
"They are very loud and bass rich, very nice audio quality but too much loudness affects the sound quality and the quality becomes somewhat poor, sounds good at 75-80 percent volume"
"Build quality of this product is not good, can not be used for longer time. It starts paining in the ear. Instead add 100-150 to budget and go with better quality ear phone"
Good
"Not even a year has been used , both the ear piece went audio less"
"It's great for everyday use and have a really good 👍bass and sound quality. Wires are also great just it doesn't cancel the noise much , you need to volume up but that's not a big problem"
Mic is not working after 2-3 weeks & I am unable to return or replace policy that's why I am giving only 2 stars  to it.
Sound quality and bass quality is really good... Affordable
Boat_ 242 is Paisa vasool productSound_ bass_ is fantasticBass - 10/8Sound-10/7Trebble-10/7No-1 Boat companyThanks- amazon
Worth buying if the price is under 500
"I didn't feel comfortable, even the sound quality is not that much good, if it is of Rs 200-300 then it would ok"
Product is really nice - good sound quality..But how can i found new ear hooks of this earphone if i loose one ?
I love the packaging of the product...but pause and the call recieve button is didn't working but overall the sound bass and noise quality is so good👌..and the good thing is they had give a little pouch for carry earphone..good
"Good Product By Boat,n Quality is goodI think built Quality can be improved n sound Is balanced And I personally feel ear tighter not goodOverall Product is 4/5"
Ekdam faltu packaging hai!! Or sound quality ekdam 50 wale headphones jaise hai.bass ke nam pe chiz chiz awaz ate hai!!! Very much disappointed from boAt!!
Affordable and Good Quality
Completely satisfied with these earphones. Bass quality is excellent. Gaming experience with these earphones also satisfactory. Finally it's a good product & trusted.
"What a lovely experience... I'm just going crazy with this and I was just waiting for this Amazon sale and u can't imagine It just cost me ₹399..and 242 bassheads is comfortable and lightweight it can be used while gym, running, travelling,etc.  Thanks Amazon 🖤"
Pros:Sound quality good for the price.Quality of the product is average compared with Boat 100 bass head phones.Cons:If u use this for more than a hour..U will notice pain cause of its ear lock design.
It is good....but not best....u can buy it if u do not cover noise cancellation in account
Have been uaing this earphone on daily basis for office calls. After just 5-10 mins of usage it causes severe ear pain. Tried using it on low volume as well but still the issue persists
"there's continuous background noise. the microphones wont work.. this is good just as a headphone, not as a headset.sound is good. But disappointed with the microphone issue and call quality.Not at all recommended."
Even though everything is good. This one doesn't works well with my phone. Automatically disconnects when plugged-in. This doesn't happens when I used other ear phones.So it's your choice.
Stopped working in 2 months of purchase..Don't waste your money on this
Honestly its the best earphone i ever had. Using almost an year now. First time iam using a headphone more than 5months without getting damaged
"Seal was broken. Really disappointed with seller. It has happened twice with the same product...Before purchasing,  please check whether the volume +/- is working properly, both function the same - increases the volume."
Value for money..😊 Worth every penny👌
Sound is too good and noise cancellation is also and perfectly fit on a ears the problem is only of a bass .boat 242 provide less bass as it was a sporty earphones 🙄
It's very cool 😎 & excellent reasonable price very honer to have this product best earbuds very good bass music 🎵🎶🎶🎶 quality is excellent I lov this water 🌊 proof & strong wire boar Roar
Good sound quality and worth every penny. Best wired earphones in the price range.
One of the worst product and ears are getting pain. Poor sound quality.
"Boat is always rocks , this product is very very good... Better than boat 225 .. BoAt always rocks..."
Used for only 5 months. After that it get stop working. Go for real me buds 2.
Satisfied with the item
Product quality is good for it's price. Audio quality is good.  Noise cancellation needs improvement
"Received a defective piece , as of now I'll only give one star rating . After getting the replacement of the product  according to that I'll give the rating !!"
Average sound quality.
The sound quality is good overall but the cover of the 3.5 mm jack came off after 20 days of usage that too when I am only using it occasionally.
Nice earphones.... I recommend for PUBG lovers and bass music lover..
"Writing a review using after a month, sound quality and noise Cancellation is extremely good but only drawback is ear pieces got loosen and not fitting in ears."
LikeGood quality of cabale usedSound goodBut its expensive if we see wrt its sound qualityWe can get same quality of sound in mi earphone but due Chinese product i switch towards boat..
Sound quality was good but not working after 2 months of use only. Total waste of money.
I used last 2months and its quality is good
"I was traveling when the product got delivered & by the time I checked the same, one earphone wasn't working at all and by then the window for return had closedWould request if a replacement can be organised ."
Not expected results as mentioned
Good headset only concern of the rubber around the ear piece.
Everything is just awesome
Got spoilt in few months. Not a rekaible product
Handling is great and it doesn't fall down from ear even while moving or runningMust consider for running or gyming but bass is not that much high but sound quality is really desent.
"It is a good product, sound wise best, bass wise also best but bringing down to durability it disappointed me. Not to worry you have one year warranty on this product so if there is issue with the quality- go claim it free of cost."
"This product is really good for sports. But in this ear phone i face some problems like one speaker work only second doen,t work properly I face this problem after 1 month taken out"
"Superb quality , best sound effects , evergreen boat"
Sound bhut acha hai ishme koi karab hone ki baat hi nhi gaming aur song ke liye bhut acha hai clear and comfort sound hai
"Wow this is my first time ordering a earphoneGood experience, the earphone quality is excellent, good bass and sound quality, this earphone worth it …I recommend to buy this stuff"
Using for week so for so good earphone are amazing fit in ears perfectly
Music sunne ke liye bahut badiya hai game ke liye bhi bahut acche hai but game ek time bass jaida ati hai or green wali mat lena bahut jaidi kharab hoti hai
"After, useage about 15 days.I would sayThat headphones are quite good nice bass and sound quality is fair enough at this price point .They are quite loud with almost no sound bleed."
"Sound quality is Excellent, bass is minimum and noise cancellation is average in my opinion it's a good product because it's helpful for me in gaming. It can easily detect footsteps."
Excellent
THIS  EARHONES LASTED 1 YEAR AND I USED ROUGH AND TOUGH I SLEPT ON IT AND THROW AND RUN ON IT IF I WAS TAKEN SOME CARE IT WOULD COME 2 YEARS IF U R BUYING THIS BUY THIS DONT THINK JUST BUY THIS THIS ARE BETTER THAN 1000 RS EARPHONES
"I got this product at an amazing price. Arguably the one of the best earphones at this price range. Base quality is superb, noice cancellation is amazing, built quality is great and also resembles good design."
Left side is not working after 1 months 😏Sound is good but durability is bad
I recieved broken ear on one side I did Not open the package for 1 months and so I didn't check wether it's working properly or not and I couldn't not exchange as the return date as expired
The sound quality was not impressive. But its an anverage earphone in terms of sound quality.Nicely packed and a pouch was provided to keep it.
Maine 2 kharideMuskil se 3 mahine chala phir ek side ka kaam karna band kar diyaDusra wala earphone ka bhi same problem aane lga hai 🥲🥲Realme bud 2 hi achha tha
Good
Good
every thing is ok but not working in one side speaker after one month.
It's mic stopped working in a month.. Don't buy.. There r better models for boat
Very very nice wired earphone. I like this ear phone and very looking cool and osm quality and sound clarity. I like this earphone. Bass is very very osm .
"Budget earphones, for HD QUALITY sound, comfortable bass (not pure high bass), better build quality and lasted 3 years with decent usage. Willing to buy again."
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
 Superb product .you should buy when the discount sell is open .I also bought it on discount prize -399rs only that is a good deal ❤️
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
" I really loved the sound quality, the bass is amazing."
Can't us continuously for 20 minNot so comfortable in earsCan u 225 of boat product instead of this.
"Expectations did not fulfill, try another one if you like good sound and base"
Good product... Worth of money.... Go for it
Product is very good but bass n noise cancellation is good where as i was expecting it very high like headphones
Great deal at this price.Issue connecting with laptop as audio talk.
Good earphones in this price range. Color is nice. stands out. wire is thin. If used properly. it might last long
Its overall quality is awesome in this price range.
"Design aur colour bahut acha hai,likin uska Mike bahut bekaar hai. Kisi bhi aap par live nhi kar sakte ho,kyuki aapka voice(sound) hi nhi jaata,kewal sun sakte ho bas."
Product is good but the service given by amazon was not good.. i didn't get the agents cell no. Thats why i couldn't connect with agent nad my pakage will be missed from my side... Product is good..
Its amazing to hear the playlist with warm mind. The structure of head bud quit better . The sound quality is very good. The bass effect is crazy. But the cable is transparent and also we have to make sure the soft handle of it.
Buy this product only if you want it to work for 6 months. Though sound quality is good the earphones are not sturdy and gets damaged early.
Buttons on the side stopped working.Volume issues on the left earphone.Really depressing since its has only been a little less than 2 weeks.
At this price its the best thing.just go for it.
Volume buttons are not working as expected... Had requested for replacement but strangely even the replaced product had same problem.. Volume up and down keys both are only increasing the volume
"I like its colour specially & the design but the sound quality on max volume is kinda feel like sound coming from a torned speaker. However, the earphones is very good under Rs. 500."
"Sound quality is good.But after putting the jack on the phone, there is some noise when the jack is shaken round and round. And if you put it in the ear for a long time, the ear is getting sore.After six months mouth speaker is damaged."
Good
writing review after 3 months later still good condition and no problem until now
"I really like the sound quality and its a bit sporty good for the bass lovers in price and its good with buildSadly though , the fit can be better coz after 2hrs of continuos usage its a bit paining"
"Good build quality, not excellent but delivers decent sound, punchy bass and most importantly clear audio without any distortion therefore clear vocals, can be used as your daily driver for listening to music and jogging etc."
"Good but I got defect piece ,when ever I try to increase my volume from the button it automatically decreases."
Product was good but noise problem which I faced on call again and again.  May be such product doesn't support on my device  or may b the product was internally defaulted which I don't know bcz I am not a mechanic.
This product quality is very cheap..it has not been 1 month..and left side ear speaker came out...with handling with a lot of care...dont buy...sound is good...but product quality is very bad...
Good
At 399rs these are the best earphones you will ever get.
"Aswm quality, just go for it."
"Sound quality is very good but the build quality is very poor it's not recommended moreover, realme buds 2 are far better than this"
"Sound quality is good, I liked it."
"I like this product, sound quality is good.  Noise cancellation is there.  Received so much thing as you all can see in photos."
"Earphones are good but not for mi note pro 5, there is problem i  jack its not connecting, and disconnected just by little movement"
"Outstanding earphone. And 100% value for money. Very good sound quality and bass. It is perfect.But, i got different colour which i have not ordered. It's  also very nice. No problem"
"Glide yourself to Nirvana aboard your Boat wired headphones, BassHeads 225. The feather light, best headsets offer you HD sound with super extra bass. Perfect gift for your love ones"
It is stable and very comfy fit in ear. Active noice cancelling is not working with my samsung. But is good for calls and music in indoors.
Good one... But can't expect headphone quality.... If you want ipx4 rating go for it or else bassheds 225 is ok! Don't buy by seeing price(original price) or the deals.Also don't go by seeing version number... Always look at the reviews... And take it if it's available only under 500rs
"Not really sweat proof, the mic has lot of issues. I had it replace it but the 2nd one had mic issues within 15days. But it is comfortable to wear for a run and sound is I'd good"
Stopped working with in a month.. Average sound quality.. Noise cancellation feature doesn't work..
Very good buy at this cost. Execellent sound. Wanted an earphone with mic. Very clear full volume. Have to adjust the volume from phone for hearing audio. Better than any highend headphones .
Satisfied with the product quality and performance.
one of the best earphone under 400
I write this review after 5 month use.. Sound quality not so good.. After 5 month of use one side speaker not working. Bild quality also poor..
"Clear and metallic soundGood bass ,Look wise it is awesome.Braided wire means strengthAfter using it for few days there is change in sound pattern so I returned it."
Worth buying with decent quality. Happy with the purchase.
"This is the best product for the music lover  , because the bass quality perfect sound clearence is good noise cancelling is much better but the jack is damaged for using 2 months"
Good 👍quality 👌very nice
In the first days it is good with build quality as well as sound but later it become worst after using few months unnecessary noise produced in the earphones I doesn't support to take by anyone
VERY HIGH BASS AND CLEAR VOICE BUT AFTER ONE YEAR USE THIS BASS SHUT DOWN..ONLY TREEBLE HERE ....
I never see the headphonesBuild quality is good bass is super
Product quality is good. Sound quality is ok ok
I am using for my laptop has been my mobile it’s working superb clear sound..Within the low budget

Most
I bought it from Amazon one month back and it's already stopped working. I've purchased many boat products before but this one is such a disappointment.
Good👍
Best sound quality..but after 30 min my ear is pain because comfort is not best to long time music listening..Overall Sound and Bass is awesome..
Within 6 month it is not working properly got immediate replacement
Sound is good fhattii ni hai awazWire badii haiUsme choti si bag bhi hai 5Rs ki pr achhi haiExtra ear bud bolle isme mille nhiPr product achha haiI love it
"Superb quality and dont think for second option, just go for it.. really nice ..😊 I loved it .. 😇😇thank you amazon , thank you for early delivery.. it's really best for  #music lovers♥️"
As per price it offer good quality & more over a INDIAN Company
This is the second time I am purchasing it. Very much satisified.
Good product at this price range 399
Amazing
It didn't even last for 10 months properly. I'm disappointed honestly. The base tore off even though I took great care of it. Forget one year warranty when it can't even last 10 months properly.
"Stylish design with great sound quality, waterproof coating and earbud support.. Got in just 499 rupees!"
"I really did like the build quality of earphones, sound is also good.I did read so many positive reviews regarding bass but bass is not good, it's okIf you are a Bass lover then don't go for this one."
These are superb but the cost is too much Hogh compared to some other better earphones under thw same cost. . It is working fine and look is Good
Good product but very less noise cancellation.... Sound & bass quality very good.
Went for d brand name but turned out out to be low quality.
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
 sound quality is very good but build quality is not goodNot nearly sarvice center and  I am very disappointing this products
"at first thought its a big gamble,but its worth buying...good bass ,good voice clarity.now also same quality after more than 4 months.durable , excellent build quality."
Sound quality is good...looks nice also
The earphones are good enough given their price but can only be used as a secondary audio device. Tjey are not very durable and started giving me troubles within a month of purchasing them
Ni
After 2 months usage there is no any defect in earphones just go for it this is one of best earphones under 500 and also good for gaming excellent footsteps clear gun shots
"I like it for waterproof and tough quality. Sounds good. I play pubg, listen to podcasts and everything working great. Better than expected"
Third Class product wrong part sent...No proper response from amezon ..worst experience ..pls don't buy dis
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
 Quality is very bad 😞
Awesome earphones..... Just like i wanted..... Clear sound.... Nd clean bass...... What all does a music lover want.....
"Sound was good but very worst quality of Mike use if I call someone they can't hear our voice properly.,if u r buy for calling then go for other brands ."
Liked it but got repaired within less that 2 months. Which dissappointed me. Now I'm constantly fetching for a replacement cuz the product has warranty but it's hectic to do so.
It really a good ear phoneIST sound is amazing and softIt is strong and valuable productCable is also good and long lastingI really like it
"Worst ever experience using a headphone... Within 3 weeks of unpacking, one side of the headphone stopped working... Even local headsets will have more longer life."
Superb product 👌 trustworthy brand..

" Box clip is white in color,but original color of clip is green color, dislike this.Replaced but same color I. e. White clip found"
Use less wire broke after 2 months use
Good 🙂 449 rupees.
Best earphones for me proper fit and comfortableSound quality and base was goodBut bus cancellation was not good
"Does not work well on mi phones, you can not take a call by pressing buttons on the mouth piece, sound is good"
I loved the product delivered to me!
"Product is good, and best for the price..Packaging is worst..I ordered this for a gift.. But worst packaging"
It is really good.Sound quality and bass both are up to the notch.My only concern is it takes about a week or so to get used to the earplugs as initially it hurts a little.
It's a very good product. Value for money and it's build quality is fabulous. Have tried so many headphones before but this seems to fit the gap I always was looking for in complete budget.
"A One Sound Quality , Volume Controls Are Best From Boat Audio And It Is Worth Buying This Product In This Price Special Thanks To Amazon For One Day Delivery.I Have Great Experience With You.Thank You Amazon Team !"
I need ear phone bu i ordered that is damaged and i throved that ear phone and it not in my hand . And this is very bad expectation from ear phone
A really great quality product with affordable price
The product is good but doesn't last for long. I could hardly used it for 5 months and then the mic stopped working. Highly disappointed!!!
"I got damaged product, the packing was not good, I expected so much one this product but it is not good."
"Product was so nice, quality, bass etc was so good. Well I sleep on this headphones during night time unknowingly, but product was working as such.Thank you"
It depends more on your ear structure how it will play out... It cause pain/irritation  outside of your ear ...everytime you put earphones on it eats lot of time to fit in. I don't recommend it... Thank you!
Not worthy
The microphone is not a good one.So if you are buying it for calling purposes then pls don't.But if you wanna hear the music then this is adequate.
Bass is not much there and cable anyhow feels lighter and tangled
5month m barbad ho jate hai boat k airfones 3 bar le kr dekh chuka
The reason am given 4star is becoz after putting the earphones in your ear after 5 min it start hurting your ear or else every thing is good...
Must buy.  Very good sound quality hands free under this price range.
Good Product
After using for months I can say that after using for an hour it will hurt ur ears we cannot use for long time and the built up quality is not that good
It's worth every penny...
This boat for sure doesn't sink
oNe speaker stopped working after 2 month.Not a good product
"sound quality is awesome ,base is not too loud but too good ,make you feel like you are playing music in car,no disturbance,can listen music 24 hours if you can,not recommended for gaming."
It is perfectSound is awesome and more over a sturdy build qualityBetter than boult wired earphones as well as realme buds 2
Earphones are bent not straight. Not easily fixed on ear. Sound quality is good.
It is a light weight product that fits into the ear very well. It's sound quality is also good with nice bass. It is a nice product under this price range!!!❤️
Good but during call sound is not adequate
Best purchase made till now in terms of earphones. It has been more than 1 year and headphones are working fine great sound.
"The earphone I received started having sound problems within a month. After it was repaired by the company,  after a month the problems started again. Pathetic experience."
Noise cancellation is good product and built quality is nice but I expected 3d sound but not found hwhen hearing 3d songs in earphone it seems like as general audio output overall nic product.
Bad sound quality and product is not good. Not working after few month of purchase. Return policy is also not good they return the low quality product which is half of the price of this earphone
"Sound and bass quite good, but under this budget realme *earbuds 2* is 2times batter,Realme earbuds 2 have more powerful bass and detailed sound and cable quality also greatSound 5/4Bass 5/3Treble 5/4"
Hardly its been a one month and the voice cancellation issue has began sometimes i can't able to pickup the call through the earphone automatically volume is going plus and minus
Well but not up to the Mark...clear sound..bass boost not satisfied...ptron boom 2 is better than boat 242..
Best attachment with ear!
Liked the sound quality and build quality... nice packing... overall very good product for this price range for daily use just go for it.
Worth buying at affordable price happy customer😊
"Sound quality is good.If the earphone had an L-shape connector, it would be much better."
"Bought this one 3 months before.... Very good product, worth of money.,, One disadvantage is not same for all costumers, bcoz my colleague bought the same but bass quality is not satisfactory...."
"Super good , Quality was good at this price point"
The sound of the earphones are quite loud but due to that loud sound there is no clarity when heard on increasing volume. though works well on low to medium sound. The bass is also average.
"Amazing bass,Very comfortable. I m using it from 5-6 months and found this product great.Go ahead and buy...cheers!!!"
Excellant bass quality.
"For the price range, does a decent job"
The mic quality is pretty bad.Mine was damaged for two times and I was caiming repairs from warranty.I'm pretty sure I couldn't be using the mic soon after my warranty expires
"I was using boat basshead 152 and 100 then i bought this and trust me, this is beast"
Excellent Product
Sound quality is good and mainly wire quality is very good. After 7 months using I am writing the review.Value for money
1. It works perfectly with oneplus OTG cable for those handsets which doesn't have earphone plug-in support2. Boat should consider more mm driver earphone/ear bud in the market
Kinda good.... But i also have 225 and i think sound of 225 is better...Personal opinion...If you prefer look then go with this or you can get 10-15% batter sound with bit less attractive look in 225
"Colour wasn't as vibrant as shown on pictures, maybe I expected way too much."
Not for long hours.It will give pain
Boat bass is awesome. Sounds awesome. Great sound. Worth the cost .
Dont buy it wrost quality. Not recommended for its price range.Sound quality is not very good. And build quality is the wrostest i have ever ised

Very good product and great value for money. Good sound quality.
i have problem with headphone boAt Bassheads 242 Wired Sports Earphones mic is not working properly so please  suggest me how can replace it or provide me contact no. and also amazon not giving the proper replacement details for this headphone
It stopped working within 7 days..really disappointed...no service centre in my area to contact....
I disliked that the ear phones do not work while calling.
Plz don't buy this product.. Jack not working after 2 month...And customer care is not  responding.....to mail or call...For showoff ..warranty.
Highs sounds so cheap . Bass is good . Quality is good for the price
If you're looking for sound quality with bass then this is it. The ear buds are very ergonomic and comfortable. Either ways at this pricepoint most of the earphones sound the same. Go for the one you like the most
Sound automatically getting adjusted. Calls get terminated if attended on earphone.
worth for moneybest qualityawesome designsuper earphone in the wired series if you are thinking for a bass earphone don't wait.. boat is a best earphone  go for it
if you use it soomthly it will last for 2 months...if you use it ruff it will go in 1 month. where only one ear plug will be working
"Earphone is fabulous, sound quality is awesome they look exactly same as picture on Amazon. side benifit are that they are come with carry pouch and cable clip also comfort level is very good in one sentence value for money 🙂"
Sound quality is goodEarphone mic not workingI recently buy the wired earphone. But his mic  is not workingProduct type : boat Bassheads 242 Black colourBuying Date : 25-Mar-2021
Sabse bekar build quality hai apne aap sare purje purje nikal jate hai ekdam bekar build quality mat lena pachtaogeBuild quality is -2.Sound quality is 3.
It's one of the beautiful in looks as well as good earphone should go for it
Design n color sound quality is good too
"Useless, in fact. I didn't use it not even for 4 to 5 times from the day I purchased it. But one side ear bud is not functioning.disappointed!"
Okayish headphones which can be used for minor purposes like listening to songs. Not that great for attending office calls.
"Now i can use earphone after my headphones it is loud and clear , quality is 👌"
The smell of the material used is unbearable. And it doesn't go away even a month of using... I don't think it'll reduce at all. Never expected to encounter such an issue with a pair of earphones.
For 550rs....this is the bestWith 3 pair of budsI am really satisfiedGud bass and sound qualityAnd perfect fit for everyone
Good
Wire doesn't get tangled
Ear Fiting is not upto mark.......it hurts while listening after long time.
The sound quality is good.Just about what you expect from this price range. But the mic quality is very bad. It takes the background noice more than the actual voice speaking.
I bought it and had this damage. ( Sound of left in right and sound of right in left). So I replaced it. The second one too had the same issue. Worst headset for gaming
Balanced sound quality
"Excellent product,none of my ear cord last this much 1.7 year,,it was still working but i broke it accidentally"
Could have been more better.  But satisfactory at this price range
Sound quality is decent and feels comfortable while using it.
Good experience so far.
Would give 4.5 out of 5 starsOnly problem are the holders which clause bit pain if kept in ears for long time
very easy to use & fits properlygood sound quality
"For the first use.. it seems like.. what i have purchased, was not giving thae feeling... but after 2 or 3 days it was good in sounds.. so overall is okk, i got it for 500 4 days ago.. overall ok product."
"They are slightly uncomfortable to use as you use them for long, your ear will start to pain. Bass quality is just worse. Sound quality is ok. But as you aspect from Boat it is not good."
"Box was torn, seal was broken, scam call came ( data leakage from Amazon).Sound quality , bass etc also not upto mark ....Product Not worth spending even Rs 350...looks cheap...."
"Audio quality of earphone is good, but it's Mike started malfunctioning after only 15 days. That's why not recommend to buy this product"
Perfect is What I'd say definitely worth the money it's really great and perfectly fits and doesn't move no matter how much of action u r doing they're even good for gaming!!
Quality is good but not long time listen song.Bas quality not good
"Sound quality is simply best, liked it.Bass & Trouble are balanced."
Fab
Good my mom liked itAlso it doesn't fall from the ear.
"This sound in the earphone is not clear , it's like the cracking sound , Totally not worth it its guarantee card is of no use .Where I can replace it ?"
"Not as expected,  I have taken for good bass,  it was not there.  Very poor bass and noise too much.  Not at all suggested and worthy for the price."
"I was expecting better quality this time, but again BOAT disappointed me by providing very low quality mic as my voice of then breaks even in excellent network coverage.Worst product!"
"Good earphone, good and loud sound great build quality, for this price range"
Not the best earphones out there in terms of comfort in the ears. Cannot use it for longer than 15-30 mins. But sound is decent for the price!
"Awesome product, best ear phones with perfect blend of sound, treble and bass. Superb noise cancellation."
Just bought it on 19july we are in September... Please don't buy these my mic has stopped working. Imagine not even 1.5 months
"Plastic Build quality is not that good if u have used 238 is bit premium,but it is weightless u can wear for long time.sound and bass are bit almost similar i bought it for 399 if u get in this price then go for it"
Waah Majha Aa Gaya
"Everything is good, but it doesn't have noise Cancellation, which is the worst thing, when we talk mostly the outside noise other people on the phone hears first..."
The build quality is very poor for this price range.Sound quality is fine...but the build is really bad...it won't even last a month...Very bad experience
The product quality is not good.
"Great product. Using it for the last 1 year, still the sound quality is the same, good noise cancellation, overall a very great product would recommend buying this."
Nice 👍😊
It will work good for 1 month. Then it doesn't support my phone it automatically on/off musicUp/down of sound. And after then its one earphone doesn't give any sound
"I didn't expect this sound sound quality in boat. But just Really amazing sound quality, bass, vocals, sound clarity simple amazing"
"Best material at this price..Sound quality is superb..Easy to handle, comfortable to wear, Enjoyable to handle and happy to get it in good condition."
Product is ok but build quality even worst.Don't buy.
Built Quality is poor and price is very high
After 15 days of purchasing its stopped working.I have gifted it to my mother and she has used it so sincerly.product is verry fragile.dont purchase
Very bad product. Don't buy******
Very good headphones. Sound is loud and deep. Doesn't fall off the ears. Doesn't tangle. Recommend.
Bad quality donot waste your money on this product because I use this product for one week and mic is not working and volume is getting up and down automatically. Third class product
It Just  okay nothing great.
"3rd class quality sound. Totally waste of money don't spend your money in these type of handfree purchase a branded companies handfree or headphones like Samsung, Sony etc."
Very nice product..
Sound quality is goodBass is average not as boat rockers but its okComplimantry pouch is not usefull coz the size is too smallOverall good
Sound Quality I like so much. Noise cancellation is little poor but all over very perfect product for me. Delivery boy was very impressed person.
I am Using them from 8 months there is no issue even i have used them while swimming 🏊‍♀️ but nothing happened to them.
I bought it 6 months back and after a rough usage of nearly 6hrs per day it stopped working. Even the bass and the noise cancellation is too good. I can surely say that for a normal person this earphones  can work for 1-2 yrs.
At 550 its a mega deal. Variety of colours love that. And a proper compitition to Chinese companies
"Got much more than i expected frm the brand.. amazing clearity,amazing comfort,amazing bass n it is LOUD! Worth buying at the price range,infact worth buying for twice the price. Perfect for running n even otherwise."
The sound quality is pretty decent.It is obviously for the bass lovers but still performs good in the overall sound quality.better choice for people using it while doing workout and running.great product in the price range.
Purchased this as part of an offer. Got it for 500 only. I think it's a good option. Good quality mic
"The product build is good, earbuds fit right, but a little disappointed by the sound quality. It has a buzzy sound when the volume is increased by more than 50%."
"Headphones are good and well built... But the bass is knowingly more than usual, which cancels out the low ends... Overall it is really good for the price offered"
Good
Superb earphones at affordable cost
This earphones are perfect compare with other earphones in this price range. These earphones are more towards treble side and slightly low towards bass.Overall I would recommend these earphones in this price range over other earphones.
The amazing sound quality and bass is superb. And the noise cancelling is simply  fantastic. I just love this product. I have done water test also but no any effect.
Boat Earpohne always Nice Product in this price. Over all value of money and clear voice with hearing lock system is a modern look over all nice earphone boat in this price below 500. Any one buy without any doute.
Audio gets overpowered by too much bass. Not at all durable and right earphone stopped working after it dropped from the chair.I would suggest that you go for other brands.
"Would suggest it to those who are looking for good quality, but affordable earphones."
I used the earphones but after 1 month the earphones is working on side only
"They sound really good especially under inr 500Bass is docile, not bass heavy at allErgonomics can be better"
"Sound Quality- 5/5,Comfortable- 4/5,Bass Quality- 4/5Gaming- 4/5 (proper detection of enemies)Overall Best Product👍👍"
Ok product. Not good sound quality. Sound quality not better then my 3 year old boAt earphone. Disappointed!
Boat products are mid category  don't expect high performance  from it.. but atleat they could improve  quality..
"The earphones are great, fit in nicely in your ear and offer good sound quality."
"A Buzz sound keeps coming and it is very irritating .I replaced the item but the new one also has the buss sound , so I just returned this ."
"I love everything about this earphones, but one side stopped working, don't know what is the reason, It has 1 year warranty though."
If you are looking for excellent earbuds that fit into your ears without discomfort look no further!
It is the best earphone for sub400 price rangeVoice quality is good & so is bass
Nice one. I have been using it since 1 month and got fabulous output. Just clean it regularly and it will keep on giving you it's best.
Sound quality not good
Just okish headset don't expect something extraordinary with this one.
Am bought it before 2 months.. Still now the sound 🔊 quality was awesome.. Noise cancellation perfect.. It is mostly good for young people who love bass in music
This perticular product is very noisy and do not supporting calls. Creating unwanted noises to the caller on other side.Very disappointed.Going to replace it
boat Bass heads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Active Black) Good product &  amount is reasonable as well as base is also good quality.
It's a wonderful product.. I am using it daily many times for my office calls.. from laptop and mobile.. good one
Bass is good 8/10But song/music without bass sucks👀like for real.Also when u play PUBG footsteps sound is okay but when u fire guns it hurt our ears👂
Good choice... Can go for it...amazon box is well sealed but inside the earphones package is already opened though earphones are new ones... And I think they are not completely sweat proof
The boat earphones are best but if we buy it in offer or some discounted price they gives us low quality of earphone which will malfunction after few days.
Good bass and sound quality
No DoubtIt's the best productOnly one disadvantage is that the net at the tip gets removedNot very steadyBut good job done by boat
Not even used for 1 month & not working. Pathetic
"Amazing sound quality, decent bass quality, decent noise cancellation, overall a good earphone."
My rating 10/10Such an azm product from boat...never expected this much bass and sound effect. It will never disappoint you just go for it...
I'm using this earphone from 2 months.. its.. quality is very good i want to purchase one more i already have.. 2 😁
Most important thing about this earphone is that its bass quality is very high and sound is melodious . But one thing which is not so good as its noise cancellation feature. But at this price I think it's best. You can go for it.
Worst product ever. With in 3 months of purchase it stop working. And the number which is provided for warranty regarding is also doesn't exist. So don't but this product ever.
Noise is well known for bass.. Good product with nice sound clarity and bass output..!one of the good product in mid range value..
recomendedd
Amazing product and value for money
Very cheap quality product. The connector pin wore off within 4 days of normal use. Also the box was open before. Sound is too good for the price. Only mids are not clear but lows and highs are clear and punchy.
Pros:-Very Good Sound quality-Good Bass-Good Quality rubber wire-Fits in Any ear perfectlyCons:-Gets Entangled Easily
The bass n treble of this headphone is really really good in this price segment .. Go for it 👍🏻
It's sound quality is good for this price and working good after use of a month.. Delivery was perfect and product is worth for its price.
Waste product..I have placed a request from return...even #Amazon has not picked the return.it scheduled but no Amazon executive has not picked the product. Waste product
Sound are good and everything but I've been using this from November 2020 now it's not working properly one bud is not working sometimes. Hoping that Amazon will replace it for their customer satisfaction 🙂
Good product..delivered ..Rs 500 in total.. packaging is nice..free pouch..the ear plug feels difficult to get adjusted.. overall good.. sound quality is not as much as JBL but build quality is good
"Nice pair of earphones, the sound quality is amazing.The ear starts paining a little once you use it continuously for more than 2 hours as the size is a bit big. But its worth it. Go for it."
Been using them for the past 3 months now. Faced no issues. Total value for money for me.
Average quality product Go for it value for money in other words not bad not good
"Ek kaan band ho gaya hai, sunai nai de raha hai dhang se kaise karu iski pushti.."
Value for money. Good looking. Sound quality is great especially BASS. Go for it..
"Its the best one, in this price range. Sound clarity, noise cancellation and bass quality is as expected. It fits just fine and does not fall off, on the move. #boathead always!"
"These earphones are good. Bass is very nice. Especially I felt like I am in a theatre. An Indian company with this much quality, truly amazing. I am satisfied. These earphones are truly worthy guys. I suggest you buy this if you are looking for cheap and best."
The item i got twice but every time with new problems firstly it's mic use to stop suddenly and in another peice the wire was break.
I'm thinking this product may be good but I was wrong
The earphone in the box was as per the description. Very good quality!! One of the best I have used thus far. Cheap and real value for money. Definitely a go to earphone
Product is okay-okay...good thing is they offer warranty for a year
Good sound qualityTangle free wireLove this product ❤️
After a month using it whenever I listen songs it automatically changes the songs or pauses the songi dont recommend anyone to purchase it
"Didn't like these earphones sound quality is very low , and also have very low noise cancellation , i can hear my wife shouting at me even after putting these on full volume"
nice produce. mic is working good. liked it a lot.. bought for kids online classes. quality is nice and packaging is also good as usual.. well do e boAt
Package was good. Quality is super. But in some times there is some noises in headphone while not hearing any songs. I think it isn't amazon fault. But the headphone is OP.
Nice sound quality with bass.
it's fine but the problem is it isn't working properly in my phone .Earphone Port keeps making noise every time i plugin in my note 5pro.
MIC is not working within 25 days from purchased date. We can't return also. better donot buy this Product
Excellent bass.. but little bit large for small ear people
One side of earphone is not working.......in use of a month..
The pause and play buttons with the volume buttons both do not work ......  i replaced the items for 3 times but the problem was constant
Sound quality not great but okay seeing the price. But sound quality could have been better. Beats get unclear and noisy if you listen even in 70% volume. Overall good product.
"Really best earphones under this price segment ! Decent sound quality , noise cancellation and good for pubG to hear footsteps of enemies ! With good bass ...."
"As most of the bluetooth headphone devices does not accomodate meetings, this proves to be best to be used for meetings."
Not durable and very delicate.. in just 6 months the wire from the earpiece started to come off which resulted the mic to go off
Good product but little bit increases bass qulity
"I returned the product once as both the volume controls and play/pause button were not working. The second time, the volume button worked but not the play/pause button. Unexpectedly bad."
"If you looking for a good quality earphone . than , this is for you , trust me ..  I use it since January 2020 , I highly recommend you to buy this earphone , superb bass , clear sound , build quality ... It's an extraordinary product .. I am very happy with this earphone ."
"Not a technical music freak. But does the job for me .. one less to- charge thing in life .  Besides fone , watch"
"Awesome quality and superb sound and bass and perfect fit ,love boat...after 17 months plus usage ,it's still a beast"
"Overall good but I am facing connectivity issue, on my redmi note 8 pro.. Just need to remove and reconnect once it solves the issue. But product is fantastic🤘"
What I liked about the product is that it sounds very good as per it's price and the bass is just terrific. Good purchase overall😀👌
Sound quality is good however discomfort to ear due to earbuds structure. I really like earbud models of iphone or samsung Level U
"Good product by Boat.. This is reviewed after almost 1 month of usage, and it is really very comfortable.. and sound quality is superb.. 👍🏻👍🏻"
Cant keep too long...Good for laptotonly
poor quality product .Better to buy jbl or other brand earphone
"Sound quality is great and bass is just enough,hey you get what you pay for,but after a longtime use of about 8 months right earbud stopped working"
"It's 1 month used review - product quantity is too good , sound perfect and if u use Daly 5 to 6 hr than also it's comfortable and Nice to hear 👍"
If u buy this earphone i suggest you wrost your money beacuse i use this 9day then i letter one side of earphone was close sudnnely soo dont buy and save money i suggest if u want buy choise is yours
The product started malfunctioning after only 1 month of use despite having a 1 year warranty.
Gud earphone in this range. But feel heavy on ear while using. Sound is awesome .
I bought it for 399.So I got a good deal in this priceAlso I prefer this as compared to realme buds 2..Best earphones under 550
Received a Broken / defective earphone...over all product quality is super good.. But seems the earphones which i recieved is old or maybe used. And even broken from the left bud.
If you want good music experience go for it 😉 none other brands can compare this quality at this price
It's working fine for me.main advantage is wires are covered with some pipe type outer layer so less chance of getting the wire cut.
Not a good choice for music but can use for voice calling due to low bass.
Sound quality Good but not better then realme earbuts 2I can sagest to all of customer to bay realme earbuds 2 its costly low and better sound quality and smooth HD
"Earphones are best in this price segment, I will say a balanced sound and high volume, also getting a good brand in this price is awesome. Loved the product."
"Superb headset!* Supirior built quality.* Rich bass with crystal sounds.* Media play/pause, Next/previous switch.👍👍👍👍👍"
Sound quality is very good. Cable quality also good. Noise cancellation good and Bass quality also good.Just one point that 3.5 mm Jack should not be straight.
Amazing productValue for money
Improvement of bass and sound proved is required
"Good bass and sound clarity. And most importantly very durable. Have been using since more than a year, yet no problems till now. Very good earphones at this price point."
Product is genuine but won't last long bought it in the month of November but is gone in the month of march
Very nice.Reasonable.Superb sound quality
It's good in all but I'm special offended only for its design... It's design good but we need more mordenize design. Overall it's ok and good👍😊
"The overall product is good, has good sound quality, but if you are searching for earphones that you will use 2-3 hours a day, it's definitely not a good choice. You will face ache in your ears. So make your choice wisely.🙌😉"
Nice sound quality and bass is perfect. Worth the money.
Sound quality noice cancelation good quality of buds ever thing was good boat 242 ear phones but one more thing fiting y's u guys feel trouble in few days but affter that u r feel amazing experience _____ 😎😎😎😎
Genuine product with a year warranty and the earphones perfectly fits the ear with no worries of falling out
I Like This Product But The Only Thing I Hate Is Made In China Bagde On It.
Good Products
"Well these are superb...the voice is super good, and the best part is even at half vooume of phone it produces too loud sounds, noise-cancellation-epic...i am too much happy with the product..Thanx amazon :-)"
Superb product
"In just 2 months earphones are not working facing technical problem,No service centre and support available in medium or small size cities"
"Lite, comfort & easy to use.  in future same product should come in Type C support"
After connecting to phone without playing anything some odd sounds are coming. Background voice. Disturbance. Ordered 2 products from Amazon. Unsatisfied with both the products.
"Good sound, value for money.Too much Bass :("
Not as good as I thought but at this price nothing would be great.
Simply Amazing.
After using sound is ok bass is perfect. But something is missing on sound. And this is not remembered for gamers. For gamers go for realme buds 2.
product as per expectation. Always buy branded products
Volume Button is actually not working for Volume +/- but it just skip the current song.. so request you all to double check once you receive the product.. Hence Replacement request raised immediately.
Color is totally different as shown in picture plus while calling background voice is clear and your voice shimmer in others calls but rather than this product is good
One of the best budget friendly pick
"I liked everything including quality, bass etc.But night ith ittu kidanu samsarikam ennu vachal nadkila, hard surface anu.Pine atraku untangling onm ala...Tangled aavunund."
You have to set equalizer for treble. Bass quality is very high like most of higher price range products. Noise cancellation is average I could tell. Overall Sound quality is better from average. My rating is 4.5 of 5.
Nice
This item purchased by me through you. It has one year warranty period. Now it's microphone is got defective. How I can initiate refund/replace process.
Just one month of using it the sound from the right earbud has decreased drastically. I have to keep adjusting and using to balance the sound. Pathetic.
"I have been using boat bassheads 225 from 3 years and found these earphone better than them in terms of sound quality, comfort and sound quality."
Amazing sound quality n design in such a low price ..one of the best wire earphones i have tried ..if u r lookng for good earphone u must gof for it ...
Mic. Is stopped working after 1 month use and customer service is very poor. It's been 2 month passed after giving to customer care but still headphones not received. They are not supported. Don't buy this headphones.
Good quality material n sound also...value for money 9/10
"Its sound quality is very good, nice soothing colored model, light and good grip."
"not as good as advertised, no bass, pathetic sound quality esp if you are watching movie. I am only angry because it is not how it was advertized sound quality wise"
Sound quality is really good. Only problem is the fit. It's uncomfortable and falls off the ear very often.
It's always rocking brand.
A must buy wired earphone under budget
If you are planning to buy this headphones go for the black color headphones this color or any other color other than black has no braided cable
Using after 2 month my earphone not working properly . Automatically sound volume increase and decrease . When I'm try to contact to service center no one answering my calls.
Overall good headphone. Fit in ears very good. Sound is decent. Gr8 to take calls but you have to make sure that mic is near your mouth.
"Build quality is really great, but i dont understand why it keeps loosing its bass after around 2 month, i replaced it twice still same."
It's best at It's price point the only reason why I gave 4 stars is because of its support bud which causes ear pain when used for long sessions but over all its a good choice
Good quality. Bass output is good. Satisfied with the sound output. Mic is working nice in calls. Recommended
Noise cancellation is not as expected
"Doesn't worth price... At the 600 rupees price, better quality earphones are there.."
The product is good considering its price. The only issue is the wire as it is not tangle free but it is coated which makes it more safe.
Wont last long bad build quality but the sound is good
Best designed Earphones under rupees 500...The sound quality is good...its not fully tangle free....its just a less tangley...I buy it for 499 rupees...and its worth the price.
Best earphones I ever had. Amazing product in reasonable rate.
Finally I found a good earphone. Sound and base is good. Doesn't slip out of the ears. Wire is light.
After a month or two one of the sides is gonna stop playing for sure. This happened twice with me.Better go for another earphones if u ask me
"Very good sound, worth buying. Value of money. Boat is superb"
I have used it's 2 unit and adviced my friends to buy this and at least we have bought 6 earphones it's amazing 😍😍
"Comfortable and bass is quite good, I have boat eardopes 441, speaker and all of the items of boat is simply awesome.Trustble brand for sound system."
Excellent product by considering it's price.
"I bought this headset, after one week  one side gone can't able to hear. Sometimes I should adjust then only it is hearing properly.now totally gone.i think I might received a fake one please check and deliver the product."
Great experience Boat
"Best in class and better nosie cancellation, worth of money and do purchase it because its a great product you can get under ₹500 in all the aspects"
The audio quality is best between 60 to 80 percent but after that you'll feel a little bit of distortion. The mic quality get a 5 out of 10 cause it is not good in catching the voice.
Bass is painfully high. Return is not available. Only replace with same item available. Not good for soft music listeners. Causes pain in ears.
Don't buy this headphoneSound quality is very very poorNo noise cancellationOnly for poor class music not for calling
"Good earphones. Build quality is nice.Good quality bass on high volume. Crystal clear voice notes. Good job on the built in mic, it picks up audio at a good distance. Overall very good earphones in comparison to other brands in such low price. Must try!!"
Really good product. For the price they’re asking it’s really good value. Better than some brands that are 3 times more expensive than this one.
"Quality is very good, bass quality is good. Nice product at this price."
"Not reviewing this on behalf of the whole world, it's just my experience. The buds aren't as good of a fit to my ears. Even the build quality is average."
One side not working after one month of use. Do not go for it.
Good product in it's class
Sound quality is not at all good. Sound is like of cheap headphones. Not upto the mark. Waste of money
"Item as described, additional earbuds provided to match your size"
"Sound quality and Bass quality is not good at all.Rest design and ear gripping is awesome.Great quality,But Sound quality is not good as mentioned."
"I liked its colour ,look ,sound quality and disliked it's design because after using more than 2 hour you may feel ear pain ."
Awesome Product And Awesome Quality Just Awesome...
"Good ibn hearing and nice. But mic is not that good. Have to keep really close to mouth and have to talk. But over all its okay, good & nice."
I m the first time user of this brand headphones but it is very good
I am using it from one month and have got world class performance in this lead a great lead for online class purpose. And also excellent for gaming purpose. 😊😊😊😊😘😘😘
"Everything is fine, but when I exchanged, the service center was given me a cheap earphone which is lower than my earphones. The rest is correct but I got it wrong from the service center."
Excellent productSpecially for gamingThe footsteps are very clearly heardSound quality is also pretty goodSaw a bit degradation in bass after 3months os usage
Sound very much likeBass to goodNoise cancellation good
Good quality
The sound quality is really good and the bass is spot on. The noise cancellation is well for normal level but it can improve.
Nice product JBL is always good
sound quality is above average.bass is little bit lower that boat225.product build quality not much good.overall nice product at this price range.
Sound bahut acha ni hai agar ap bahar call pe ho or to apko awaZ hi ni aaegi thkse
ALL ARE Good But PRODUCT WAS  WRONG SEND EK ME SOUND AA RAHA HAI OR EK ME NAHI
"It will beat any other Earphones 🎧🎧Bass , Sound , Quality , Durability / Everything is Amazing ..This one of the best Earphones from Boat ⛵😉"
poopiest earphone. -100 quality. don't buy
"Feels like sitting in cinema theatre, good base and sound quality is very nice"
Very good earphone with realistic sound and made with good quality materials. I bought it at ₹449. U can consider it upto 499 ( it will be still a good choice).
Within Four months one side mic not working.......wastage of money.
I like this earphone but you should work on its earcups BOAT because it fits well but also it gives you your own head voice which is not good.
Thik laga
Regular user of bOAt
Mike is not writing in one of the earphones.Unable to use the buttons available on the earphones this is disgusting. This is my 3rd order i didn't got the old quality
"Very poor quality,  one side ear plug stopped working just after next day .Please please pleaseDo not purchase these products."
"Firstly I like the pouch that I got with this product , sound quality is also very good. Overall good product at this price. When I ordered this price was low."
Very good sound quality very good for both music and verbal..
Mast ❤️
Value for the money
"Earphones are worth buying. The bass, sound quality everything is perfect. Earphones looks more cute in green colour than black and red."
"cute, clear sound"
I need to change these earphone because after using 3-4 months it's not working properly and not working now please help me to replace these as fast u can
Not worth the price and very sensitive
bass lovers must buy these. Bass is mind blowing. Noise cancellation is OK. I can say u surely u can't keep full volume after using these earphones. Amazing quality. Love these amazing earphones.
I ordered it around 3 weeks back and after using it for like just 2 weeks the problem with the earphones begin. I constantly keep hearing buzz noise as soon as I plug in the earphone even when there is no audio being played on it
Sound quality is good and fits to ear properly.. Overall good
Very good product.Sound quality and Bass is excellent.
For me its sound quality is up to mark 👌🏼Initially the rubber ear hooks are bit painfull if used for long hours but eventually our ears get used to it.
Build quality is good and sound is balanced when kept at 70-80% sound. Also good bass though I'm not a bass lover. You can plug out ear fins.
Needed

 Good audio quality but after 1 month the audio of both speaker become low very bad experience
If you use earphones just to listen to music then it's fine but if u use earphones for very long then it may cause trouble in your ears.I am experiencing pain in my one ear.But the quality of sound is awesome.
"Isn't really comfortable, painful to wear for long listening sessions. Also pause button stopped working for some reason."
The fitting is good and bass is also great it is a great purchase i use it for calling and the mic is also great 😊
"This is very good product, easy to use, sound quality is great and the wires are water resistant. Smooth experience while using. Microphone quality is also good.Like to recommend others."
"After Phillips and Sony. I got this headphone yesterday,  comparatively this one was  super and nice. Bass awesome .. worth for money. It is real bassheadsI just post one day review. I don't know life period. Worthy headphone"
This product r decent.Not high-class...and not low class1 year warrany is super feature500 rupey is best deal
I dont recommend this better you can go for boat 172Boat 242 has more bass completely i dislikes this one
Bass 10Noice cancellation 9Build quality 10Looks 10Fit in ear 10Triable 10It's very strong alsoOver all i will give it 9.5 out of 10
Don't buy it. Its useless
Best sound qualityMuch Better than my previous earphoneGood bass.I love it. 😍
"This hearphones are good but you can't wear them for long becoz it starts paining in the ear and dnt feel much comfortable in the ear, rather than tht everything is amazing"
"Okok product, better than cheap footpath earphones"
Nice quality product it's really good if you want to listen music or want to do video conferencing it stops background music when you are using this
Good product. Does not knot up.Good sound quality
"Good. The mic needs to be pinned close to the mouth. Other wise, recipients complaint of low voice."
I got it before 2 weeks still it's good. But last time also I purchased a Boat headset but that didn't go for 1 year. Let's see how long d new one go.
This review is for those ppls who needs above avg base & clear vocal mid lows . Way better in terms of comfort compared to 225 ( metallic build sucks) . 242 light weight clear & crisp sound nd nice wire quality.
Good sound but damaged automatically after 8 months using
The product is awesome. Music plays on altogether different levels 🥳❤️🙌🏻
Worth the price
My headphones are so fake . one headphones jack is bo working. i want replace . either i report the Amazon.i published in social media. reply or contact with me
Sound quality is good but no bass
I return this order but didn't get refund...... And the clearity of voice is worst.... Buy seinnheiser cx180 best headphone without mic also but boat headphones is worst quality🙃🙃
"The sound quality is very low, and I want refund but they r doing replacement which I don't want 😡😡😡 I hate this which is not good and it is taking lot of time 😡😡😡😡"
The retailer doesn't provide an invoice which is useful for warranty claiming..My earphones jack was disturbing after using for a month and the warranty was also not claimed...Very bad service
Very bad quality stopped working within one month. Don't buy this.
Durability is very poor....it is just 3 months and earphone stopped working....I didn't use rough...I mainly used only for my teams meeting .....I didn't work as expected...!!
It's light in weight which is very good the quality of the wire is also nice but bass is less . Overall you should buy it if you like listening to music and don't like bass.
Owsom product. Good sound quality. Easy to tag on ear.
I like a product. Amazing sound quality. Value for money product fast delivery thanks Amazon thanks seller
Cable clip is different from the actual dark green clip. This white clip doesn't look good with the earphone. It seems this product has been used before and someone replaced the clip. UNSATISFACTORY
Product as expected
Ear buds missing....extra ones were there....ok product sound quality wise.
.Sound Quality is very splendid..The bass is soo powerful.. Excellent sound quality. perfect fit in your ears.value of money
"On call other person hears disturbance, for music it's working fine.."
Wire quality not good but earphone is good in 500 rupees price
"Its good at this price, nothing more to expect. Its uncomfortable after 15min of usage"
While speaking on calls opponent get the resounding I have face this problem on every call worest experience on taking of calls in these eyerphones I want replacement
"So far, the ear codes are good. The problem is the ear grips are not properly designed, which causes pain if u keep for longer time. I replaced the ear grips with soft ones. Now they are perfect."
I m not happy about this product. Sound is not clear. Bass is also not good. May be its a default product. No refund options.
Good
"Sound is good, so is the colour. It's durable too, not a flimsy built. Mic gives decent clarity. Length is pretty good for running. No complaint so far, been using for more than 6months."
"Loud and not the best sound quality, but value for money"
Nice design good sound quality
It's a decent product in this rate. You can call it a value for money product.
Now it's year nicely working super product
I got it for 500 and its worth every bit. Quality sound and bass
"In 500 rupees, sound quality of this earphone is really awesome. Meet expectations. Wire could be more strong."
I have odered it a month ago so far it been good the bass quality has been great and the sound quality of the headphone is also been good . Good product affordable worth your every penny
Very bad dont buy trust me
I like this 👌item i.e Boat 242 Headphone red colour. Over all I can say after using this item u never use another one of any brand headphone in this price.💯💯💯
"The earphone jack is not good and isn't L shaped, Don't buy it if you are a rough user."
If u want an earphone under 500 go for it .Just remember if u r going to use it in PC then wire is short but for phone it is okay
OMG. Very good. Value for money.
This  product just ok. no big expectations from boat.
Good earphone by boat and its value for money buy. Clear audio with good noise cancellation. Quick delivery from Amazon.
Sound quality better in segments
The bass is very good and very active noise cancellation this is a very good product I tried water proof test and shockingly this is the water proof ear phones am using
Waste product.Recieved duplicate. Go for real me buds 2.Note. Purchase in realme store don't trust Amazon or flipkart for low cost electronics.
IT is really a good product and value for money
"The bass is very accurate and sound is perfectly balanced, every instruments and voices are clearly audible. Overall these are my favorite earphones till date"
Extraordinary.
This earphone is osam. It's bass quality is very good. Style is another for other ear phones. This product is very nice about this money range. Gaming experience is wonderful. Pubg sound is clearly hear in this ear phone.
One side is not working and it's not been even 2 months
Light weight and comfortable version of Basshead 225 but mind you the sound is exactly like 225 maybe more better. Go for it 🤘😃
Bawal chiz hai bhaihamko laga achha nhi hoga pura value for money hai
The sound quality and the bass is  amazing.Only drawback is that even after a very careful use  the wire got damaged near headphone jack and the mobile stopped detecting earphone.
Good quality product at this price
This one is so amazing but not built for gaming so if you're looking earphones for playing games then this is not the one!.... Besides this the earphones are best👍🏻
Nice product
"MY PRODUCT IS UNDER WARRANTY, BUT NOT WORKING, KINDLY EXCHANGE WITH NEW ONE,REQUEST YOU TO KINDLY ARRANGE TO REPLACE  / REPAIRS MY ITEM, SINCE IT IS NOT WORKING -"
Very good
The volume getting lowered on its own. In most of the music videos couldn't hear anything. Poor output and poor sound quality. Returning it.
Good material and good to feel. Quality wise very good with good bass. It doesn't fall offthe ears.
"Best in terms of everything (budget, build quality, sound quality and noise cancellation)"
Great earphone with great sound quality and good bass. I got this earphone in Rs. 449 within 18 hours. This is a great quality headphone in this price.
Very nice on this price range.
Didn't even use much. I had bought it for my mother as a gift and then one side stopped working. Nd I thought would be suitable and won't pain while Hearing songs
"Nice product... This is my second order for the same product.i am using this for more than one year, very good to use. So i ordered the same product for the second time.."
Good productI m happy thanku AmazonFast delivery to seller
"Best coulity product, but next song botton (fonction) not available."
"Pros - Bass, wire qualityCons - Can't be used for long hours.But that's not a major con for me"
I read the lot of review then purchase this product.Sound quality is not good  bass is very low ...Samsung basic earphones is much better than this boat earphone.
Awesome BassAwesome TrebleValue for Money
This product is very goodIt's bass and sound quality is very good this is very good for pubg gaming enemy sound it properly give enemy sound and for musicI love this product
It does not satisfy the sound quality for the price as i got it for 549 and now they are on sale and they are not giving my refund back.
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
 The product is excellent....!! Bass is little low but overall it's very very good..!!
Just buy it

 Much better than I thought. Really great deal and thanks to boAt.At such a low price
Good for running or jogging. Doesn't come out. Sound quality is better than what you pay.
They didnot stay even for a month waste of money.
Best earphone in this range..3 buttons and the design of earbuds are unique and attractive.Good for gaming too
Just don't know why boAt removed flat cable for this model.
Worth the price I can say. If you are really looking for a good headphone for gaming or may be for some music with really great bass (for the cost) . You can buy this product blindly.
That white ear lock is painful for me🥺 thankful that its removable✌🏼 otherwise its pretty good 🤩good sound quality... colour is damn 🤩Edit:-  after 11 month one ear stop working🙂
The product came with no damage. Nice sound quality and bass quality. Worth for the money spent.Happy with the product delivery and working condition.
Trouble sound is too much and bass is very low. Not for a good earphone rs 500 range.It is performed like 200 rs earphone.
Excellent product👍
Quality wise awesome n cables are tangle free keep it up boats.. as usual Amazon quick delivery thank u
The headphone's one side has defected. I claimed the warranty and I got the fresh product in 4 days. Best customer support from Amazon and Boat..
Awesome product really enjoying the sound quality boat did a fantastic job on sound quality
"I loved the durability, it's wire and the extras with the product, everything is of great use. Voice cancellation can be improved"
Amazing head phonesSound Quality superBass Quality superNoise cancellation very good.Best product within the price range
Worked only for selective mobiles. Have not worked for my Phone Nexus 6P.
The product quality is very bad. Sound hearing very harsh.After one day to use One sound pod is damaged and not hear any sound in one bud . Product is damaged and quality is not good
Just ok in this price
You are going to get one of the best earphones at this price range sound is good  bass is smooth its overall a good earphone go for it trust me good for gaming also
This is kinda okay okay product …. You can go for it but don’t have high hopes about it.
This earphone is beast. Best in market of wired earphones. Just for it without thinking anything and without hesitation.
very very good product audio and recording quality is very good
Very bad experience with earphone saund quality extremely bad and bass is very quality wrost product i recomend never buy anyone.
wanted to see why this earphone is too popular so bought it but unfortunately my 150 rs earphones sound better than this..
Lasted for 3 months only
Good product. Nice noise cancellation and sound. Very good fit in the ear and doesn’t fall off easily. Durable and light.

" After 6 month , playing purely good, bass is ok. And i am using it gently. The only problem ix its removal from jack as it sleeps from my finger tips."
Sound quality- it's produced smooth+ sharp noiceBass quality-  4 Star coz of bass level is something might be lowNoice cancellation- 5 Star profect.
Best earphones in this price point. Also supports Dolby atmos surround sound. Sound quality is also great. Just go for it.....
I although like the over all product the sound bass treble is upto the mark but i dont like the comfortability of the earphone I feel like it's heavy.
"I have used Realme, JBL, Samsung, Mi in similar price range, this is a clear winner. Go for it!"
Best qwality he sound best durability best ek saal chla skte ho
Everything is good but due to it's very tight fitting in ear it cause pain in ear after longer use otherwise sound quality and bulid quality is good
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
" Wonderful earphone in Boat, its bass level is very adorable and sound is amazing"
"The earphone is good for listings music and playing games like PUBG , COD and compatible with all 3.5mm jack port .And comfortable but noice cancellation isn't good but overall good  🙂."
Good buildMedium sound- very good for the price.Overall a good buy if you buy at 399Worth max 500 - 600 ruppees
This is my 3rd product from boat.. Build quality is good and sound also good.. go for it..I got this under 500rs.
"It is not working within a month, it weirdly stops, the music and make the call mute or end the call. Worst earphone experience."
Very bad gaming experience. It has a minimal bass. I wont recommend this for daily users. At this price range those want water resistance for the buds then go for it else it's lot better with the Bassheads 225.
Good
Nice... but a little bit Overpriced.My previous bould earphone was much more betrer than this.Not returnable.
Good sound quality and good enough bass...overall good earphones.earphone box was bit torn at top when received ; rest was perfect.Good product at Rs.550 price range .
Worst product because of fault it's not working because of fault in lead. I guess we can't compete to international or Chinese product for that matter.its so annoying I can't use it at all...An
mic is not working as well as not compatible with most of the device. had requested fro return but no action even after 15 days has gone. Completelty disappointed.
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
 Sound quality is great 🔥🔥🔥
I'm very happy this one bying boat productAnd Amazon service very good service.
Waste of money build quality is so bad buds often come out the cable is also worst but sound quality is good dont expect bass have a decent bass
Good quality sound
"They're so extremely uncomfortable. I've got my ears paining because of these. No sound clarity, just noise. Your ears will pain super badly if you're planning to wear them for a long time. Not recommended."
Good sound quality under this price. Pretty sturdy and non tangling wires
Ok
Cheapda quality earphone depends if have used Earphones like realme buds 2 and ptron boom 3 or some above the budget earphones then u will not like it i am damn sure about it
Good headphones for the price range but it's it's in ear support feels a bit uncomfortable to me. But overall good base and sound.
Listen everyone .... Please don't buy this hedphone poor sounds quality waste your money 💸. 200-300 price ok for this hedphone . Only Design Ok .
Got spoiled in a month had to throw it very disappointed money wasted
Nyc and durable earphone in reasonable price.... Suggested to my friend too
I bought before one it is perfectly fit with ear . Sound clarity good .now it's not fit properly quality of sound also low
The product started giving problem within 3months..now it has stopped working..total waste of money..
Bought 242 Basshead from boat but they are not working properly some time left sode channel does not work and some time automatically pause the song or video
Volume adjustment button never works i changed it for 3rd time and still the same problem
"This earphones is worth it of that  price range , Boat brands all products is very valuable or different from any other brands in Quality an good given the Customer."
Good qualityValue for money
It sounds really good... The only downside is that the 3.5mm jack is really slippery and hard to disconnect it with your device sometimes
Not much good as I expected.
"Sound and looks are good. Issue with flexibility. They are not tangle free and not sturdy at all..at the insertion point,it will might get tear soon..overall good."
Sound wasn't good but if you use for calls on travel this one is awesome
Poor material quality
Good product
"I'm using this earphone since 1 week, it's really an amazing earphone with super sound clarity and bass. I would say this is the no1 earphone under 500."
I was bought this product RS 449 from Amazon. Compared to realme buds 2 wired earphones is better than this product.. already I was used realme earphones product.
Great headphones for this price point. The sound quality is good. It's also very durable I don't think it should break or stop working regardless of how rough you use it. All in all its worth it.
Well this time totally dissatisfied with the product i got.After two months of heavy usage I'm getting a auto volume lower issue whenever i do plug in to any device.
"In terms of sound quality, it's good but not comfortable to wear this for a long period of time as it hurts the ear in terms of fitting of the earbuds."
Not worth buying.
"Sound quality is good , earbuds are stylish, it has a nice look but cable quality is not much better than other boat earphones."
Control panel not working I return this item and they again send me this product and issue remain same . What a wrost product don't buy it...
I purchase one pc Boat wired Ear phone on 12 may . This product now sound problem. I want to return or service this product. Please know to me process return this product.
This product does not support footsteps sound in game like bgmi (pubg) so don't buy for gaming if you not gamer then you can go for this other wise waste of money
Before this earphone I was using JBL earphone I can say now after 7 days use that both ear phone have neck to neck sound quality
Value for money
"It is very light weight , you can use it whole the day it will not feel like bulky in your ears,Best earphone you can buy it.Thank you."
After Two weeks I am writing the review worth of the money 👍 bass is too good and noise cancelling is 90% good
Bass quality is so nice and valued for money. It gives satisfaction for music lovers. Only thing is that kepping those ear buds more time in day without relaxing can hurt ears a little bit.
Fentastic headset super noice cancellation. Good brand.
Very best earphones for gaming people but music lovers and bass lovers this earphones are disappoint  you but bass and sound quality are very best than normal earphones.
Didn't live upto the hype. Okay product at the premium price paid @499/-Sound quality is just Average 3/5Build quality is good 4/5Amazon Service 5/5
I have been using realme buds 2 for the past year so I am not sure that's the reason but I believe this earphones are not upto the mark
Worst product ever ! Mic was not working .. Even after a replacement ! The product is showing same problems .. Mic isnt working and no one can hear if i speak ..
Over-all it's quite good.. I'm bit not satisfied with the treble.. I mean it gives a bit more treble.. bass is good and it's comfortable in war I would give 4 stars .
Very good headphone. Boat is very good product.
Highly recommended
"Good earphone at this price, it hurts ears when you use for long time , ergonomically not that good. Should prefer other boat earphones at this price."
Sounds very well with good bass and we can feel the music 🎶Noice cancellation is not much but okayBuilt quality is okay
just 10 days over  not working  one side also not able to return  contact number  aslo showing wrong  number  very bad service.  no response still from boat team
Nice sound. I am writing this review after using of 3 hours. The sound is so good. You can feel song.
I like this product.I am giving  it genuine review after 1 month awesome quality like new very nice product I liked.Go for it.Thank you #boatearphones#indianbrand.
I'm satisfied
Sound quality is best and base quality is also good as per the brand.Need to improve- they must provide us some kind of material to make the headphone clean because after some weeks it will not look nice same as before
"Good Sound & Bass,Very Good Mic, Audio Output Is Superb,But, Build Quality is Poor.My Headphone Jack Is Damaged & Not Working Now"
Extremely good product.....clarity of sound is oesome and boat is known for super bass quality obviously its bass is too powerful....Loved the product.... service was great..#recommended
"Sound is clear and good but bass is not so good that were in the boat bass heads 225 , so please improve this in the above versions."
Ok
sound quality is normalbuilt quality is go
Absolutely Perfect earphonesUsing it from more than 6 monthsAnd it still has great sound qualityI'm a very rough user and I'm Amazingly surprise with build quality. It's still same as new
"This is my review instantly after unboxing.Sound quality is quite good, wire looks durable and tangle free..Overall good product."
Sound quality is very badBass is no as like expectedJust only High sound
It is hard to opposite person when we are on call fully noise with ear phones Mike not suggested to buy this for calls and meetings.
The rubber extra fitting irritates & pains the ear folds. The basic 45 degree curve design is a flawed design. Pains the ear if used  for long
Got it for ₹499. Good quality at this price
Product is very good . But my earphone's right side sound is not working in 3 months .
I am writing the review after using it for 3 months and believe it's really a best gaming headphone under 600 and boat is the best company for earphones 🎧🎧.
Sound quality is good with no distortion but it lacks bass. I don't know what they have named it bass heads it is so ironic. Everything is good except bass.
"Better to go for flat wire one, this product is one of the mistake of brand. They should stop manufacturing this model."
I used it 2 months but after that its left earbud start not working… I am very sad…But About other things it is best…Go for it 🙄😇
Bass poor .Sound quality poor and got damage piece two times.Better buy Rs30 earphone from Railway Station.worst earphone ever buyied
Good quality product and same as mentioned in the description
Perfect micPerfect sound quality..Extremely good for gaming..( it provides accurate footsteps of enemies during game).And most important is it has a good value for money
"Very nice product..recommend others to buy this one if you are looking at headphones in range of 500-550 rupees. Fits nicely in the ear, looks beautiful."
Good earphones
Loud but very harsh sound. Hurts the ear
"Not giving long life, with in 2 months you have to changed"
It has stopped working for last 1 month. Only one side is working. I want to return it but now I can't though it is under warranty period. So be careful before buying.
Some voice is missing in between and not working properly
"Why it's so hyped, the sound quality is poor."
After 3 monthsThis is in same condition in which I purchased itBalanced bass and noise cancellationStandard voice quality even after 3 month continue use
Good base and clear sound
"Sound quality good,super bass ilke head fone"
Headphone is made from plastic. Poor Quality. Better to buy product with Metal earphone. One side of my earphone got broken
"It feels awesome, Superb bass & audio quality, build quality is quite good, I would be more impressed if it has braided cable.But I'm quite satisfied with this headphones."
"overall nice earphones, bass not that good as written in other reviews, great vocals, buds quality could be better and fins take significant time to get used to."
Good
The overall build quality is good and sound quality 4/5 bass 4/5 and noise cancellation 4/5 if u are in a low budget buy this earphone..
I expected the quality will be better but the quality is worst compared to boat bassheads 220. Boat bassheads 220 is best quality compared to 242.
First of all I have got a damaged product.The 3.5mm jack is broken from where I insert it look carefully when u open itI am very dissatisfied with boat earphone..Thank u
"Product is very good, bass is very high , but if i talk about noise cancellation, so i am disappointed, if you are listening songs on high volume, then along with your sorroundings can also listen what are you listening"
good
Excellent wired earphones with good build quality and decent sound output! 👍
Good
Noise cancellation is good.... Bess quality fabulous... Overall sound experience is good...
My first boat earphone and I'm satisfied with it 100/100
"Its very impressive,bass is crystal clear,vovals are suberb,bass is very excellent,i feel everything lije a theatre worthy product to buy it"
worth product in this price rangebut very little bass effect.Good for treble experience.Purchased for bass.. but little less hereso 4 stars..
Why to waste money on expensive brands earphone.You can get same experience with this product.. Don't hesitate just go for it.
Good product in this price range . better product for gamers. Starters will affect some irritation because of ear hooks . noise cancellation also working good
The product quality is average. The poych is so  nice. Base is also average. I think infinity by jbl is a good choice than this.
quality one..but not perfect sound...the bass is very high audio clarity is not good as jbl and oneplus..
its brocken within 10 day im just unknowingly lying on the headphone. Pls don't buy it waste of money.....
Does not fit well in ear
Wire quality is good.Sound quality is good.
It's a good product for the price...It has good thumping bass but it also drowns the mids in a song and the noise cancellation works pretty well.My only complaint is that the eartip does not fit my ears and it hurts after wearing for long periods..
The quality is amazing. It does not get tangled so it's a win win for me there. Sound and bass are good
after using it for almost 6+ months the sleeve of the wire (red colour) is damaged and the inner wire are exposed in many places of the head set
This is a nice product. i have used it for more than 3 months.you may also like it.
"After using 2 months,,,, problem starts...I'll never recommend anyone to buy this earphone..."
Very Good 😀😁😀😁
Sounds quality and noise cancellation are both very dull but bass  we can say good not very good so plz I suggest you don't purchase this ....
Quality ok
The sound quality of this product is good. Comfortable for long time use. You will have a great experience after wearing it for gaming performance. It is worth the money.
"I have been using it for month's in my one plus, the build of wire is soo good when I kept in my pocket or just fold it. It doesn't affect it all the wire quality is so perfect and the bass is hardcore if ur a bass lover and sound is just perfect."
Good sound quality but the build quality is disappointing as this is intended towards sports usage
"Material quality is good, though sound is not great."
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
" Everything is okay from outside but not working, still under warranty, dont know how to return"
I Had purchased that company of earphone on june but in month of august it is not working.you need to work on quality and damage things. I am very disappointed.
Bad qualityWorked for only 3 months
perfect
Good headphone.... But sound is not good level ... Trabal & Bass high ... and vocal sound is low during leson songs
"I got this for 490/- worth it for that price. Wire is good covered with protection layer. Fit in ear perfectly, bass is too damn good. Love them"
Not the best but it is good  .. u can go for it
I don't like the sound quality . The packing was good but the colour of earpone was different from the picture
Best earphone i have ever used...sound quality is best but bass is not very much high...if u want a earphone only for bass then i wouldn't recommend it...
"firstly i got it in 349 rupees, which is awesome price for this earphone , a value for money earphone, you can go for it, nice sound quality"
Price should be 400 or under 400. But overall everything is best in this earphone. Let's see durability how long lasting is this.. some shot of this is above..
"In total a good earphone, but will not last long."
Best product almost 1 yearAur pure ghar ke liye yahi wala mangaya hai 10 12 magaya hoga abhi tak
Very good earphone at this price... compared to other options.... recommend to buy...
"Just go fot it ,it is the best available now , sound is perfect"
Earphones are too good in this price range ! You can definitely buy it ! Everything is good ! At 80% volume of mobile it's gives better sound experience ! And thanks to amazon for fast and perfect shipping ! I like this product !
"It's satisfying and it'll fulfill your needs, I'm impressed with the bass and sound quality although my Boult Audio beats it in sound quality as well as in build quality. 👍"
Good product. Has nice sport look. It has volume adjustment buttons also. Play/pause button included like any other headphone/earphones. Love this colour also.
It has not worked after  2 months
"Got this for 399, best in this price range.Don't expect noise cancellation.Wire quality ok okSound quality is good"
Nice quality nice comfortable and good product  and sometimes audio jack is not accepted in mobile  that only  small issue.  Use for gaming is better choice
"Good pair of earphones, but has some durability issues"
-
Cake product received!!! Toooomuch noisey And opposite pattu hears their own voice while i use this headsets
Best quality
I have been using this earphones since one month...... Guys if you want a good earphone with cool look then definitely go for it !!!!  Just loved it !!😌😌... BOAT!! ...
"The sound and bass is just amazing. Provides perfect fit and has effective noise cancellation. So, it is best in segment!"
Sound quality is great as you expect of Boat products. There is not a lot of noise cancellation as expected and the bass quality is great aswell. All in all good value for money
"This is the worst earphones, I have ever bought .my money is totally waste .this price is too much according to its quality , i strongly recommend ,do not buy this one."
# I love all boar product.. but this is one of the best I had received till now..#tone adjustable# easy to fit ear# low prices as per brand..
Product MRP on packet is just Rs 499..False selling practices by showing product as 64% discount on Cost Rs 1490 & effectively selling on higher cost than actual MRP of product..
Very low quality material with in one day mic stoped working and start some noice on headphone... Dont buy this....
Received these lovely earphones today and I am very happy. Clear sound and nice long wire. Especially the cute goodies earphone bag and extra ear muffins is the best.
Very bad experience... 1st problem-- after 2months product not working..Repair time 15 days.. 2nd problem-- after 5 days of repair product not working....
I love this!! this is the third time i am purchasing the same product.. under this budget i belive you will get all you want...  go ahead guys.
Earphones are supb but manufacturing was not appreciated due the wire got damage and also jack pin problem also confirmed
you can hear distortion sounds while listening music. Sounds quality isn't that clear.
This product is good for use .Smooth ear buds to wear and good sound quality and 2 ear bud wears to use. Too good product as I have used still.
Best products of this price range. Value for money.
Please dont buy this. This headset seems to used already and one of the earpiece is not working completely. And this looks completely like a used one. Completee disappointment.
"Overall good product. It doesn't tangle , which is an added feature."
I bought them two months ago primarily to listen music but they stopped working after 2 months .....waste of money
Experiencing mild irritation on ears sometimes. Not a great accessory. Just feel okay
ORIGINAL QUALITY BY AMAZON
The earbuds slip out of the ear frequently. Came for a good price otherwise not recommended. Sound quality not good.
Everything is good about this headphones but just after two months one side of the headphone stopped working. I felt really bad about this.
"The name says it all. I love this product. Its sound quality and the bass is awesome.Quality of the wire is exemplary.But the package was missing a item, free carry pouch."
This products colour is not at all how it is shown the name of the color is orange or something but it is like a pure yellow and the quality of the sound is way worse than expected
"Sound clarity is not perfect,for bass lovers it's good one.But value for the money is provided."
Easy to fit on ear.sturdy.best quality.100%sure go for it.
Perfect 👍 in this price range. Sound quality also perfect.
There is no issue as such. The sound is clear however the earphones give headache if one wears them for more than 15-20 minutes .
Very good product obsessed by audio quality ..the build quality is also good in short value for money product
Product is good & quality is smooth.It longs last as have been using the same for 15+ months
It's the best product at this price range but build quality is extremely poor. Within one month the plastic is tearing into pieces.
Excellent quality boat 242 compared to 225 bass heads this is very good light weight and simple to use
Superb quality my favourite headset... One of the boat
Very good earphones in this category. Pubg gaming is awesome on this earphones. Music experience is also brilliant. Overall performance is too good. Must buy at INR 550/-. SOUND 9/10 BASS 9/10 GAMING 9/10
According to the price sound quality is not satisfied
It's not the best best headphones but certainly one of better products. Nice sound quality and good base.

Best quality with this price range from a reliable company...
Highly recommended in this price range.Overall quality and sound out of this earphone is superb.👍🏻
"Nice in built quality, good sound quality and fine base quality. So, in this price range it's a pretty nice product.However, your ears may hurt some time due to continuous usage."
Just delivered two days ago still not too much use till but its good not very good as per valuation
it is cheap but looks even cheaper though sound wuality is quite OK for the price
"Super deep bass , lovely music, fitting also nice , quality also good 😘😘But sounds cames out from earphone only that thing I don't like."
"This design makes ear damage, I am didn't expect from boat."
"I ordered this for my daily team meetings with my office colleagues,..too good and i used to listen music as well....neat and clear with out disturbance 👍"
Sound is good but overall quality is a waste .Wont recommend anyone to buy it .
Everything is good but ear canal are bit large and it given pain to ear.
Overall good for daily music listening.
The ear head  sound is good but what we speak it will not reach to the device that is back fault of your phone and overall it is good .......
Sound quality is good.. Highly Loud..Bass is good..Tweak it slightly through equilizer according to your music taste and it will be awesome
THE SOUND QUALITY IS JUST SO GOOD BUT ONE SIDE STOPPED WORKING AFTER LIKE 5 MONTHS WHAT'S THE USE OF GOOD SOUND QUALITY IF THE PRODUCT DOESN'T LAST LONG
"Sound quality is outstanding, bass quality is also good, it's more than expected."
No Complaints....Have been using daily while driving ....the sound quality is pretty clear and good ...Worth product for this price :) Go for it ...I am not sure if it works for IOS but for all Androids it surely works :)
Don't buy worst product issue in MIC

"Wires are too thin, tangled every time I keep it unorganised. Sound quality on louder side but base is not at all."
"The sound is great, treble and bass well balancedits just that the build could have been better, the plastic looks cheap and breaks easily"
Looking like local product wire quality is not good .Sound quality is ok only.Overall not good there is better earphone on same price
"Excellent bass and noise cancellation, and very  durable too. Probably going to buy it again if this one breaks."
I bought it for Rs.549 and now it's price is Rs.399 only. This is one of the best wired headphone in this price.bass and sound are very good🔥.just go for it❤️
"Low bass , pain on wearingNot worth for Rs.550/-"
Not refundable.. Whereas this lead in warranty
Love it ❤ ! Pubg footstep awesome.. Bild quality nice... Havy duty... Tnq Amazon and and delivery boy
The volume button is not working. I had to use phone or laptop to increase/decrease the volume. I request for a replacement. Please suggest me on the procedure.
Good... .  For the prize its really good.  And its better buying indian quality products rather helping china by buying cheap bad chinese products.
Ghatiua hai sound bhi achha nahi game bhi kheloge achha sound nahi aata isse achha to ptron 4 bsa wala hai paisa barbad ho gya call ke liye bahut achha hai
"Build quality, design and colour are superb.Sound quality and Bass are perfect in this price range."
Worst earphone ever used in my life had to return this earphone. It always pause the video and it's a internal problem because earphone wasn't loose.
"Everything thing is ok...the bass is good and boat didn't fail to give its level..but the wire quality is not satisfactory.... except that everything is fine....and it do not contain ""L"" shaped plugging end(to the mobile)...it's much disturbing...."
Very good product specially for music lovers.. I just loved thr clarity and in this price range this is the best ear phones one could ever get..
When you use for long working hours it creates pain in ears as earbuds are little bigger in size and not so comfortable to ears regardless of that everything is fine...well noise cancellation for the price it's a good one
Best earphone in this segment.I am actually amazed by the build and sound quality.Noise cancellation is pretty good.Definately recommended 🔥🔥
Good for listening 3D songs... compatible for OnePlus nord CE
Pretty decent sound and perfect fit in the ear. Overall satisfied given the price range for the product.
The product is really good...
The first delivered product was damaged.After returning the newly delivered one hardly lasted for 1 week.Poor audio quality.
"Mainly the jack is making problem, sometimes it gives jha jha jha sound. It doesn't fit properly."
Very poor build quality for this colour.i Have ordered lime green colour before which has great build quality but it has poor build quality
"This Product is value for money but i got speaker damage after use of 1 month ...Please, suggest me how i use my warranty period?"
One side of it is not working after using just one mont and the service centre is also not replacing it even afet in warranty too much dissatisfied
It's been a year I used boat  225 basshead in earphone  and it's sound quality it's fine in this price range go for it while u rough use its durability is great

Everything is ok but i got some noise while talking to someone in call.
"Bass and sound quality is very good, definitely it is worth for money..."
Value for money. Sound quality is excellent. High Sound. Best earphone in this price range.Must try this product.
"Bass is good, quality of sound is good, but one issue is.. the curve of the earphone plastic which we keep in ear, it will pain when we use more than half an hour."

In hand feel is cheap.. the earcups keep on coming out.. sound is good no doubt but still.. koi aur lelo iss price me
I received damaged product. One earpiece is broken. Broken part is also missing.Poor quality of service
I am very impressed from noise colorfit smartwatch. It is waterproof and smooth function with affordable price. Great experience. Must buy!!
Not at all comfortable. No sound quality waste of money
Best headphone at the price
Value of product
"Good product. Do not know technicality. I purchased for conference calls, and it serves the need."
All in this eyerphone is good but in my opinion eyer tips are not so good you need to change them with some best quality eyer tips
Mic got issue and disturbing the usage. Sound quality is good
Better to choose any other product.Built in quality is worst.Compared to boat 225 this earphone was built with low quality.While using this earphone earpain is coming within 20 to 30minutes.
All over excellent product.
Awesome price and nice earphones with good accessories of extra ear buds and a pouch to keep earphone
Sound quality very nice but there is some problem connectivity noise outcome whenever it connect with my mobile but in other mobile it doing very well base is so smooth.

"I bought this in the month of May. But in December, it stopped working. Please make sure that you buy a durable product."
Sound is amazing bass is vgood clarity is awesome literally mind blowing at this price pointAnd an Indian companyShoutout to boat
The bass is so high i can't hear the voice of singer.And i use the microphone so it record all unnecessary sounds around me except me.
"Awesome, go for it."
"Good Bass, Fits into ears perfectly and can be worn for longer periods without any discomfort."
Good at this price range i think base can be much powerful but it is decent in regular use gives nice highs and lows provide average bass and treble with clear vocals. fitting is very nice
I would not recommend it doesnt give you the output that you expect at this price in BOAT.
Happy with the overall experience. This really good deal if you get it at rs 399. Sound quality and design is impressive and fit perfectly in the ear.
Sound tuning & fill is excellent. As it is wired within 2 weaks communication barriers started during calls due to loosing of connection of pin.
Value for money.
"earphones are quite amazing in this price segment, 15hz to 15000hz range, sufficient, comfortable, light weight. built quality is not appropriate, may get damaged soon. keep it safe"
"After 3 months, one side totally fail, automatic volume down and up, microphone not capture voice"
Out of the box experience is great it's so powerful that when at full volume the earphones starts vibrating to high beats. Just loved it
These have worked well. This is my second boat product.
Amazing 😍
Item is missing on this package.  In this box in no headphone  only  warranty card only in this box........ I want my product  on my money plz. Help me
More metallic sound than bass( no bass compared to metallic sound) cant increase volume to highest as it is unbearable.
The design is good but the  Bass quality is very very poor.I recommend not to buy music lovers from it.
Awesome product by boat at this price segment.Worthy blindly go for it.after usage several months im writing this review.. light weight easy to carry.sound quality was good.im purely satisfied with this product.
The are giving but a warranty time their care is not receiving call....I am sure that boat customer care solve this.... problem
Nice product
Bought this earphone last month. Inspite of using correctly it stopped working. This is my 2nd worst experience with boat. I don't recommend this.
❤️❤️
Delivered timely and good quality
After one month of buy..this product stopped working on one side don't buy this..instead go for realme products veryyy disappointed 🙄🥲
Overall quality including packaging - 10/10
The quality of this product is perfect. Worth it in this price. Everyone should buy this earphones.
Pathetic...One of my biggest mistake... don't buy this earphones...even 50rs local earphone is better than this.Irritating sound quality
Loved using the same and I am a fan !!
Have disturbance noise while calling. Automatically turning ON speaker during whatsapp call
Sound quality is good but you can get the base at high volume only.... Sometimes it may cause pain in your ears after wearing it for long hours.
"Volume buttons are not working at all, mic is also not working at all, sound quality is average,  bass is below average overall it is not worth of 500 rs"
Worst quality. Waste of money. It has a defective speaker. Person on other end of the phone can't hear words properly
"As always, Boat is a great product."
"Not comfortable in ear 2&3 hours,,,,But build quality is good,,,,,Sound quality not so good or not so bad, it's average....."
Very good product
Nice sound quality and bass. I especially like the design and the plastic and rubber material is really good.
Fine product...
Product is so nice and audible. Quality is good. Performance is great. Thanks to boat and thanks to Amazon
I you want to waste money go ahead for it buttons doesn't work bass is very low I replaced it 3 times but buttons are still not working
this is a good earphone but.. i used it for 2 days for online classes then suddenly left side ear plug stopped working. so i returned it.....
"After return period is over, on one ear the sound stopped and there is no optIon to replace or return."
Mic buttons having issues.. automatically volume increasing and reducing.. can't except from Boat

Extremely unbalanced sound. Right plug has higher sound than left plug. Average sound quality. Good as per pricing. Bass is high.
the earphones quality is really nice but the extra part on above them makes it little uncomfortable for long period of time.i choosen the red and black color
"Very authentic one !!! Bass has a very good quality., Really worth for Money. The name BOAT itself says it all, No more comments needed. Happy Shopping:)"
Nice
Starting It Was Brilliant Experience.But After Two Months 1 Side Got No Sound And next day other one too.Hope You Provide Me A Replacement or Refund..
Excellent product. They even replaced it with a brand new one since I had a problem with the headset. Excellent service. Highly recommended. Thank you BOAT.
"I usually played mobile games or hear songs and this earphone is perfect for all tasks. Good noise cancellation, quality and easy fit in ears"
Volume switch is not working properly only increases value not decrease now its not returned also. Very bad experience on amazon
"I purchased this for my Dad, and he liked it. What more I needed 😀 The specifications mentioned are the exact what is written."
Excellent product in all aspects.
At this budget can't expect more. Good Enough
"After 3 months of average use, Right side stopped working. No response from warranty.."
Sound Quality is amazing . I do not feel uncomfortable even at the highest volume.  Bass quality is also very good . It is not less than DJ .
Bahut ghatiya Quality hai .... Cheap earphones ke jesa sound hai... Sabse buri baat ki aap isko return bhi nahi kar sakte

Very bad quality products in long term use u heart most
It's just that thing that need to be there in your ear for better fitting started coming out easily after 2 3 months of use.
"It is great for bass lovers,but at the beginning of its usage u may feel a little bit discomfort bcoz of ear holders but everything else are fantastic"

One ear phone is not working and no extra buds given I literally hate it I just want to return it
Superb product!It fits in ears easily without any pain for long time.Sound and bass too good.Appearance is also nice.It fulfilled my needs
Product was not good.The sound was not clear.I never these type of product.A bad product I never had this type of of product
These are good ear phones I have used. It has quite very well grip and quality sound. If you are want spend your money then it will worth it.
Good quality materialGood soundBass quality is also goodNoise cancellation is very nice
Good product
Product quality is as expected. But disappointed with the way product was packed. Product was not properly packed inside the boat earphones box. Looks like it was packed in a hurry.
Fits right into the ear. Good noise cancelling. Value for money.
This product is soo great for this price. It's sound quality is soo good. It also has a good bass. It is a good product for this price range.
"earbuds are too hard, sound quality is not great (no where near boAt standards) this was my 3rd boAt headphone. wires are too delicate."
Excellent
Been using it for 3 months n till now feels day 1.After 1 year of every use it stopped working.
Fake product sound quality are bad . Base are not clear .  Earphone are not working only right side are play ...  Waste of money
"It's really niceSpecially the little pouch,, 😇"
Materials not working properly
Would automatically increase or decrease sound.cracked sound.microphone doesn't work.All these issues but cant return due to disposal of packing
The earphone volume after 80 is so annoying
Not good. Bought for rs.399 but you can't pick call from earphone or increase or decrease volume.
🙂
Good one in less price
The product is good in this price range.......but overall sound quality can be improved a little bit.
In this midrange I would genuinely suggest you to blindly go for this earphone. Refined voice comes through the earbuds. It's damn comfortable. The bass quality is awesome. Noise cancellation is superb.
The earphone is awesome. It is better than I expected. Build quality is good and I love the think that it fits ear properly.
Worst
Not working properly phone decreases the volume automatically when I use this earphones..its not good ..I dont know what boat supply product like this
Purchased After one month this product right earphone is not working so please this once before purchase this item
"Sound effects and voice quality us so poor... I am totally disappointed. I am user of boat products , like sound bar and bluetooth speaker. But earphones totally disappointed me."
It's better than boat 225 and ant w56.. good for jogging. Design is  so Good and build quality is great.. Great product...Great sound ....And got it on deal price Excellent bass above 70% of volume. Sometime you will feel vibration of bass in 100% volume.😀
Wonderful ear phones. Good sound clarity and noise cancellation. Very comfortable on the ear too.
All in oneWhatever sound you hear it makes it very good
"Perfect product best sounds quality,with bass .Clarity soundLight weightI'm so happy this product"
The wire is very cheap quality you have to handle it with very care and the sound is also not so good sometimes more sound come from one side
"Low built quality and poor sound quality as well wastage of money , if you are a bass lover  then don't go with this earphone"
Within a month one side stopped working.
it's about 2 months i bought it..now its not working..
"Very bad service by boat , always ignoring customer who applied any complain under warranty, faces it in 3 items"
Jack cunnection is discunnecting
Mic doesn't work sometimes...
This earphone have crispy sound that osm some cases but not all songBut bill quality osm👌Finally it s a excllent over all
Its agood product
"Not for bass lovers, but still a good one. Not for me though."
Do not buy anyone
"Very good treble and bass. 'Balanced' if I must say, might be because my Equalizer is tuned for headsets. And it fits perfectly fine into my ears."
Good base
Bass quality is low sound quality is good and noise cancellation is lul batta suniye
Most preferable...boat customer care is awesome..their door to door service is amazing
great bass.........amazing sound quality
"Sound is not balanced but good durability , buy realme wired earphones for both durability and good sound"
"Best clarity earphone ever.Good bass,noise cancellation..and strong build up. No issue anymore."
"it's been more than a year since I'm using this, only the jack part got damaged that also due to harsh use"
The headphones are absolutely fine good to use but The headphones which I bought stop working after 4months It's Right side is not working!
The audio buttons were not working except pause one
"Quality of wire is soo good ,and packaging is also so premium, sound quality and base quality is top noch ,light weight and comfortable, Highly recommend"
Packaging is not satisfying..... but the headphones are good and comfortable. Super sound quality.Best for music lovers. Its a good for one who searching best earphones. It provide extra ear buds.
Good
"Removing jack from phone requires effort as it is soft, no grip.On the first day use of 30 min ears are paining."
Worst product waste of money. Even we cant return this item. They offering only replacement not returning money. They also know that they are selling worst products.
Very good product in  low price... worth ...... The sound clarity of the earphone and the bass .... Are very good excellent performance 👍👍👌😊👌 loved it
"1. crisp sound (not the best but couldn't be better for this range)2. Bass, undoubtedly great.3. Surround effect, impressive.4. Return on Investment, i got it for 499 and is justified.worth buying."
Very nice
"Super earphones, bass effect, sound quality is extraordinary. Boat never disappoints. Really happy with the earphones."
A very good product at this range of cost.Am using since 2 years and still am not seen this type of good quality earphone.
Boat brand is great ..sound is great ..i just love my headphones
Good Earphones nice noise cancellation and fix in the ear very perfectly.Very good tangle free wire.Long time use will get pain to your ears that is the only cons.
Just ok in this price range. I like this company's sound products and services but sometimes customer care takes much time to solve the issue.
My earphone is not working for right side as the voice is not connecting only.Kindly accept the earphone and replace with new one.
"liked the sound quality, wire, fitting everything is fine but one side of the earphone stopped working still under warranty"
Problematic earphoneBut the product is still not taken for return / replacement after 5 days after asking for replacement.
Good in terms of build quality. Excellent bass.
The buttons and mic stopped working after a week right after the return period ended. Thanks. Won't be purchasing wired earphones anytime sooner.
"Genuine product and sound quality is good, mic quality is also good. Fit to ear and bass quality is okay."
good product from Boat. excellent sound quality
The red part comes off like it is never there although earphones is working fine but looking bad without red thing
Sound is too good . Just go for it . Its lightweight. And earhooks are comfortable. Prefer it over basshead 225. Only it has plastic body. Otherwise earphones are good and sound quality is balanced...
It's a very smooth product.very comfort for ear.sound quality is gud with noise cancellation..and about bass which I love the most its quality wow..
After 3 months my eraphone begin to show many problems. and yesterday it stopped working in the right ear the wires are of very bad quality.
"The look is awesome. The sound quality is worth it, at low cost as this. Bass could still be improved.Volume is very high. You can not hear above 60% volume"
sound quality is very good and worth buy
"Best quality sound and performance , but after the return time is over, one earpiece stopped functioning. That's all"
Good value for money offer
"Bass n all fine, but problem is hard to put for longer period. Designing is very poor and moreover they've reduced the prices over night after I brought so not worth for money. Try other boat products...this is not up to the mark."
If you want to take earphone under 1000 1500 or 2000 take this earphone its under 500 and best of
Nice product..solving my purpose..
I got this for my Dad and he just loved it. No complaints till date.
The build quality of this product is pathetic. The sound quality goes from amazing to absolute zero in 1.5 months. Do not buy. Really dissatisfied
According to the price it's really good productI think everyone must give it a tryOverall good product
More noise cancellation expected
If you ask me can improve on mic sensitivity. At time reciever says can't hear you. Rest all awesome!!!!
Best product in this price.
Sound Quality is Excellent! Bass is superb it feels like I'm in my car with best woofers and the grip hold fit in ear I'll say it's worth to buy.
Good product by boat... I would like to suggest buyers.... That go for black or lime green color coz there is huge difference in quality of wire compared to other colours ..
Worst product... One ear phone is working... Another one is not working... Bullshit product
"Earphones are amazing... Just got it today. .""Sound quality"" is also amazing. Might update the review later. After using it for months."
"Ordered twice with the same issue, the volume up button of earphones doesn't work. It reduces the volume rather  I use nokia 4.2."
Good Product
Full paisa basool .Very good sound qualityBass quality bestPackingAnd carry bagBest earphone
I had problem at joint of jack point. Life of this product was only for 5 months. Not suggesting others to buy this.
Sound was good but the mic is not working and it has one year warranty and Amazon service is not responding in this productI want to chnage as it's mic is not responding
Go for it...if you looking to buy an earphone at this price range...works perfectly fine
"Good.Sound quality is decent.Noise cancellation, umm I want to give 3.5 stars.Bass is the best on this price.I bought this in 399."
Average sound quality.. Good for rough use.. Overall satisfied with this price range.
What u have shown in the picture is not same we have received
"one of the bad material used in this earphone, wire smells like you are in dump yard, very bad experience"
"I purchased this headphones and after 2 months of usage, I can't hear anything from the left bud. Now I think it was a wastage of money."
Nice sound quality.. good wire strength .. I am using it from last 3 month till no problem occurred.
Does the job for the price. Best part of the product is the wires don't tangle and even if they do is ready to untangle them.
Mic is not working after 2 months.  Highly disappoibted
Very good earphone at this price..I just orderd one realme earphone and it not up to my expectations. Then I returned and booked This.. Very awesome
"Sky color 5/5, bass 4/5, noise cancellation 3/5, sound 4/5. All-over good quality this product boat 242 wired ear headset.❤️❤️"
Good
Super product sound quality super packages good amazing
I had brought this in the month of june and now right one is not working and its not functioning properly i feel like this is waste of money
"Sound , bass and everything is below par it is not recommended for music lovers not worth it"
Very bad product i think a earphone of rupees 100 is more better then this
Superb sound quality
If you looking good quality product so you can purchase it because this headphone giving like premium quality amazing look and best sound quality
"These earphones are value for money.The bass is good, noise cancellation also works fine.Only the ear hooks hurt the ears."
Not worth for Money
Very Nice.. Superb Bass quality...
"I think it's OK for the price, nothing too impressive and nothing too bad. There's a huge distortion at max volumes. Volume at 75% is suggested for good experience."
I got already opened Piece.. What's is this
Everything is well also for gaming but i buy orange colour earphones but its look like fully yellow but yellow colour also look do cool 🔥🔥🔥
Its quality of sound and bass is as good as any other costly products. Wire seems to be strong enough.
Worth buying..... Money has value.
Bass Quality : Excellent🌠🌠🌠Noise Cancellation : perfect🌠🌠🌠🌠Sound Quality : Superb. 🌠🌠🌠🌠Product is really worthy to its price 👍
Good very nice
Duplicate item
Good quality earphones . very clear sound . volume is good . material quality is good . tangle free wires
Awesome product...
Good quality in noise cancellation and bass but sound quality is not good  After returning the package for repair or replace then also same issue.
I like the sound quality.and the colour. Also sound cancellation. Do not understand Bass quality.
Not so great but okay!
Overall good product
"This headphone is sound quality normal but i like to this bass, i recommend from other users its desine primiaum rubber metrial."
"good product, nice sound quality"
The sound quality in this price range is very good...noise cancellation is not there but it adopts very less environmental sound.
Awesome build quality material.
Good for a given price..have been using since last 6 month..no such problem.
Those who come here to know that - is the product is good or not?Blindly jusy buy this product.After reading my reviewIt is best in my view
"Good product, but may have compatibility issues with few one plus sets"
No comments
I buy this product it's so good sound quality and very bass quality but last 2 days my handsfree is not working I can't hear it and very bad sound
value for money.wires are very durable.sound quality is good
My ears are paining. I'm not satisfied with this product.
boat bassheads 242 earphones is the best earphones in this price. I like the the sound quality of it. It gives the best gaming and music experience.
Sound qaulity is very good.Wire qaulity is also good. Pouch provided with headphone is also good.
This is a Mid range budget product and according to this rate it is the best earphones  i've ever used . If u want to purchase this product i ensure u that you are making a BEST decision .
"Reviewing after 5 months, Sound quality and bass is awesome . I am giving it 3 star because of its wire quality wire got damaged from the both speakers"
Good
Not worth it.
Nice
Good one
Decent enough. Welldone boat
If you have a phon of over10k rs then don't buy..Bcz it does not work a little bit in my poco me...But in my resmi 5a it's working really good.
Best earphones you can buy at this price point or maybe above it....sound quality is amazing bass is too good...mids are ok...buy this you wont regret itSound qualitySound level highBass PunchyMids Clear

 Every thing is good gonna use it for music and gaming.. Packaging was awesome
Build quality..
One side ear bud  lost sound after 6 months of usage.  Now I want to use my warranty service but don't have service center near me..... Totally exhausted don't know what can I do😭😭
"Every thing is good but there is need to increase voice clearance. It requires improvement, 100 is better than 242 in voice clearance!!"
Sab thik hai magar jald kharab ho gaya abhi 14sep 21ko liye aur kharab ho gaya
"only looks good, sound quality is terrible, I had a 300 Rs Philips headphones, which was 10X times better than these."
The earphone is a good buy at this price but at loud volumes it's quite painful to the ear.. You can use it at low volumes. At low volume it's very pleasant to use this earphone due to it's light weight. Build quality is also very good.
Bass - 5/5Sound - 4/5Noise - 5/5Cost - 5/5Look - 5/5Comfort - 5/5Dont think much just purchase this damn earphone and it cost only 399 to me.😘🤩
"Sound qualityWorst product, never buy boat product. This was the 2nd product within months both got heavy disturbance on call."
I ordered headphone before 15 days.I got headphone from Amazon but new headphone right side not working.I have a warranty card I want to claim warranty.
The mic stopped working within a month. These sellers do not have a e-mail Id also mentioned or whom to contact for replacement
Worth of money
Received the product in good condition and it will satisfy the work from home requirements very satisfactorily.
The headset is useless don’t buy it

 Good product at reasonable price.Awesome sound qualityFit & comfortable
"This Earphones are best at its price and very comfortable ,The quality is good."
"headphone jack doesn't fits properly,I had checked these with other phones too..but the results remains the same, often it slips from the port...."
It's been an year and this still works amazing.  Same quality as it was before when it was new. Awsome gaming experience.
"Amazing product... It's a must buy for music lovers and business person who is always on calls. So comfortable, awesome look. Steal it guys before it disappear. Super happy 😊😊😊. Thank you so much AMAZON"

"Super bass, sound quality, notice cancellation and long life wire."
Listen to the songs sweetly
Not as good as jblVolume is high better than JBLBut bass less and sound quality not that good.
"simply bad product. within one month of usage, mic has stopped working. not very comfortable in ear."
Waste of money. Better to buy JBL. This is purely a chinese product by all manner
Great deal at 500Rs..go for it..with a nice look
Boat is an Indian company. So you can consider it for your use. Good and soft on your ears. Wire quality is very good.
Quality is good. Value for money.
Very good bass quality and if you look a earphone in comfort and sound go for it I loved it and its worth it price.Thankyou amazon for fast delivery and the delivery boy was good too
"Sound quality is very good, light bass quality."
The best ever in this price range (I bought it for 399) that ear grip is nice... It's great for both music and calls 💯
Over all it is a good product. The box I received was opened as the seal on Top was tampered.I had to remove the silicon ear support attachments as my ear started to pain within 30 minutes of use.
"Bass is amazing, trebble is also good. Have low latency and good for casual gaming. And perfect wireless earphones for music. Just plugin and groove."
Really bad product. Stopped working in a week's time. I have used the brand earlier and it had been a good experience but this particular product is really bad.
"Though the product is good, would suggest one to go for bass225 headsets which provide better sound and build quality compared to this."
"Just an awesome earphones bought from amazon. You can feel everything that you’re looking for. Bass is the best one ,mic is good.Perfect one for daily use"
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
 It's good blindly buy it's this company or his product never disappoint u
"Its impossible to play a game (pubg, cod, etc.) using this headset as it barely manages to distinguish left and right."
It sounds the same as realme buds 2.... But quality wise it looks premium and comes with 1Yr warranty
Quality is Awesome 👌
most worst product...
Very nice
Good product
The Sound quality is mesmerizing!Thanks To overall Amazon service n product
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
 Sound quality is good.Mic quality is good.
"It has much more treble than the bass. So for treble lovers, this is best. Overall a decent sound quality I can say."
After one month of usage it only used for music after a long try..you can't talk with this. This is a total wasteage of money
So far so good. Just have started using the the pdt..till now I am satisfied with the overall quality and performance.Value for money..!!
Excellent sound quality and design for this price. Definitely recommended.
"I have bought this earphone but now it creates sound problem, voice is not clearly hearing. I want to return this product and want to buy another earphone.Please do needful as soon as possible."
Tip of earphone was very poor.... Only reason I returned this this product is Earphone tip.... I'm sure it will soon be broken ..
It's sound quality is superb it's noise cancellation is also very good and the main thing is it's bass quality I loved it
"The best thing is that this earphones has perfect sound ,bass and noice cancellation for my type"
Definitely you can consider the product at this price but the product doesn't feel premium and the deep vocals are not as good as it should be and the output of the microphone is not loud enough.
one pair stop working after 2 months of use. i bought boat product earlier also but never happened before. very dissappointed
good for jogging and sports activities
Not compareable  with any other earphone it's just outstanding... Loving it
After 1 month of usagethe intensity has dropped to half of the previous for both the buds.really it is kinda useless now
"Very disappointed product is not working after just one month ,sound quality is also not satisfying .worst experience with this boat earphone."
The sound wire is creeping in between palying song and also have the same problem while calling. The voice record is very poor. I am wasted my money
This product is too hyped. Try normal bass heads from boat instead of this one. They’re way better than the in Ear one’s.
nice product
I like it sound and bass quality ok not for music lovers... Ok product.. worth it in these prise range
"Quality is very bad, microphone doesn't work properly and unnecessary sounds in the background..I did the replacement twice and again same problem occurred.."
These headphones are good than most headphones sold by retailers at this pricr
You will start feeling pain in ear if you're using continuously for more than a hour
Value for money productNot for music lovers but budget great value and useful 👍
Nice sound quality with good bass and  noice cancellation who loves listening to songs can go with this earphones.
Worth for every penny we spent on. Sound quality and bass are nice. But volume must be higher than half range in ur device. Fit in ear. Bit uncomfortable but it ll not off from ear without pull it.
It's been a nearly 2 months since I brought this earphone. It's really a great product that u can go for it with ur eyes closed
It is not comfortable for realme mobiles it was not setting properly don't buy ur device is realme
Good quality earphones worth the money
Water proof too superb
Tooo much bad. And Amazon is not helping out to resolve the problem. It's terrible. As a permanent customer it's too much hurting.
The sound quality is very good. The bass is also very good. Very nicely designed to fit the ear. It's value for money.
Product is getting damage easier
Good product.if you want listen songs or calls occasionally ear phones are fine.but if we want to listen continually.trybto by head set..
"Best earphone under 400 , but if you are going buy it for more than 500 , then you should choose realme buds 2 . But for me they are enough and in my budget also 😊"
Sound quality is nice.The controls are good and work with almost all phones.
I am in love with these earphones!! The sound quality and noice cancellation are top notch. The money is totally worth it! It is must buy thing!!!!
Still using it's
Sound quality is superbbass is awsomeWire quality is durableBuds are too soft
The earphone is working properly but the seal was opened. I hope you people have not given a returned faulty piece. Item should be sealed properly. Please work on that.

Good earphones for gaming
"Stop working within 3 months... Don't purchase guys, 2nd time I'm facing issue with boat brand...."

From the sound quality till durability everything is fine and perfect u can go for this product with no doubts.

"Worst product..after 1 month of usage,one of its ear plugs stopped working ..i ordered 3 pairs and out of them 2 have stopped working.."
Sound quality was better when I bought it but after few days it's stop working. Now they are not returning my order what should I do
"This product is very good. The quality of noise and base is quite fantastic. But I got the defective one. So I have replaced that product. Hope ""boat lifestyle"" will give proper and genuine product"
Gud product
Excellent quality and value for money
Good but not for gaming clearity
The first earphones were kinda damaged. They kept making krrrrr sound in the background while i talked with someone. I got a replacement and it sounds okay.
Good bass but it overshadows the sound which in my opinion limits the incrediblity of this amazing earphone.
One side stopped working in one week
TOTALLY AWESOME. product.  I buyed it in 3 coloured earphones  .The sound is Hd+ 😘😘😘BOAT IS ALWAYS BOAT⛴️⛵⛴️⛵⛴️

"After 10 days of usage, sound in the left earpiece is gone. Please don't buy."
its was good upto 6 months.. now is not working..
Absolutely bad product. It's been 3 months since I bought this and it is not functioning anymore. I am not even sure of how to claim warranty.
The quality of this product is not as much as I expected. There is no noise cancellation and bulky base on high volume.
I think this product is good. specially these design is good because this is fit in ear very easily. but volume increase and decrease boton is not work. and i retain this product but again coming same product
It's button system not working properlyIt's button automatically work without press so it's always disturbingPlease replace this products

The left side stopped working within 1 month of purchase bought two one woks great other is of no use
"The earphone didn't even come for 2months, so disappointed on the purchase. Wondering how boat is selling such a poor quality earphones"
The best earphone in this range. I got surprised with the music quality. I have used boat bassheads 225 and this is even better than this. Boat is doing a great job
This earphones are so good but there is a ok ok type of noice cancellation and bass is excellent.The earphones are also having very nice quality cord
I been using this product more than a month and i love it.... I recommend this to my friend and he is also currently using it without any complaint

" This item is rejected pieces...so offer sell..volume button,call attend button not working..."
Super light weight.. with best quality..
Good to use roughly...better sound quality though we can't expect the flagship level of noise cancellation definitely worth the money we give..
Very good and clear sound and also noise cancellation and bass quality was awsm
"I am continuously using it since 2 months,no issues are there. I think it is India's no 1 head phone in this price range."
Good one for this price.
Amazing quality and soundNo noise cancellation

Good product
Review after 6months right side earphone is not working It was handled with care only I dint understand what brand this is
The right earphone stopped working after 1 month and the mic is also not working correctly. Never buy this product.
Mic is not good. Also sound quality is not suitable for listening to music.
I like the sound quality and bass is powerful.  Value for money.
Not upto mark at this aggressive price . Noise cancellation is not working and soung quality is also not that good . Give it just 3.5 star rating only .
Its really breath taking performance sounds quality awsome
Today I received this Awesome earphoneGood sound QualityMic is also goodWire quality is okOverall nice earphone
Average
Very poor performance. And its mic got damages within 2weeks.and after 1month its Jack is not working so its fully bhrasht Product
The sound was excellent like realme buds 2 .but it's very much uncomfortable it starts paining after 15 minutes of use.
Buying this earphone means total wastage of money. One side of it stopped working within a month. It's better to go with ₹100 earphone than this.
Very disappointing experience.The voice quality is very poor and cheap.Will not reccomend this product.
This is for gym lover smart fit sounds good very beautiful design but wire is not so much tangle free but reallly very nice product
Initially it was good but after few days right side audio was not functioning then i claimed warranty after 2 months again same issue
Good
Best one to buy... Heavy sound.. Little discomfort with the design we plug into our ears.. But its okey.. Overall a value for money product.
"Left ear was giving distorted sound, send to service center twice still issue is not resolved. Don’t buy this product."

 Previous one was good. But this one have weak formation and was damaged. Maybe anot a good piece
The sound quality of earphone is great just one problem I got is that the volume up nd down key is faulty it just increase the sound rather we tend to decrease the sound
"After uses 2-3 months it's jack not working, and service center is far around 150km from my city"
Waste product only worked for 3 months after that one side sound is not coming like China earphone..struggled worst product please don't buy this product
"Nice product, good build and sound quality."
Nice sound qualitySame day deliveryShould go for this product

 Awesome worth for money. Can be use while working out.
It was worth it but i am just some what disappointed by its build quality which is nice but they could've provided with great quality.
Waste of money I bought it like 2 and a half months ago and now it's not working....also no proper warranty service available
"Unsatisfied , unhappy . with this product... sound quality is not good .. low in bass .. and very high and useless in treble .."
The earphone speaker quality is horrible. And I hate the noise canxellation. What the hell. If a little bit touch or friction occurs in the wire then your ear will burst out.
This one is so bad I have never seenRuin in 2-3 days. Wire is so much thinSo much clumsyFully badPlease save your money
It's sound quality is totally awesomeBass is like a bOOm bOOm 😎👌It's Durable cable i like the MOST of it!!!
Value for money product. Excellent sound quality.

Not as per expectation .. right side earpiece soung is too low
Nice quality and very comfortable to use

Product quality is goodBut it stopped working after 2 weeks of use  😭 cant even return itAmazon plz do somethingEven the nearest boat showroom is 60km away
"Superb sound quality and bass is thumping, little bit uncomfortable for long duration, overall good wired earphone under this prize."
Sound quality is absolutely good but if you are looking for good boom bass sound go with boat bassheads 225
"Quality is best,average sound quality"
Value for money.
"Boat is the best company for headphone, wired earphone, Bluetooth earphone and sound quality is good"
right side of the headphone stopped working abruptly and I hardly got to use it in these two months
Worst product. Package is  damaged at the time  of delivey  . Delivery guy refuses to  take it  back . Sound  quality is  not good .
It stoped working after a month can't return the product also and response from the customer care though if we have warranty. Done buy this product simply waste no comments
The.volume control doesn’t work at all. I’ve replaced it twice but the volume control button seemed to artificially placedWasted money
Sound quality is awesome 😊 .
"I used realme buds 2 before this, but I realized boat basshead is better than buds 2 , so I recommend all to go for it"
Bit uncomfortable on ears if use for long time...Sound quality is good
"One Problem, Cant fit in ear, you can not use it for your daily purpose, rubner quality is bad"
Needs a replace ment every 2 week.If u buy this earphone u have to go service cebter every week for replaxement
Mic is not very good but sound is awesome and very good for playing BGMI and noise cancellation is good but not very much better
Good quality
"It is very uncomfortable after half hour of use, the audio quality is good but since it is not comfortable, it's not value for money."
Very good product. Good bass and vocals are terrific.Overall good purchase in a budget segment.
Very cool product in this price it comes with proper sound effects Being a gamer I love it
When any kind of shaking of wire attach to the jack then sound suddenly disconnected and Google voice assistance actives.
"The piece got spoilt in 3 weeks, audio quality is below par. Mids are less, making audio quality pretty flat."
I personally dont like it... build quality is not soo good... the overall performane is bad
Worst product stopped working within 2 months
Just remove the rubber extensions for comfort sound quality is equal to my previous realme buds... Undoubtedly go for this
Good overall sound quality
For voice super but for music normal
Very bad quality product... Replaced with another piece which is also having same sound quality.Disappointed with this product :(
"Sir , Quality is not up to the mark not properly hear in one side also there is an issue during inserting the pin. Want to replace immediately"
"My headphones expired in just two weeks, please dont waste ur money, worst earphones under 500, didn't expect this from boat....."
Good bass good for gaming too when I first used it's hurt my ear but after using again and again it won't hurt you 😊
Very good Product must buy
"Good quality bass...Go for it..Review from Trichy, Tamilnadu"
Very nice quality earphones.
Good light weight earphones feels a bit cheep because of plastic construction but not at all compromise in quality all remains intact good choice for this budget I got it for under 400
Only one thing bad which is the other person sitting next to you can also listen what you are hearing that's also at 50% volume
"Bass quality is very bad, Earphones quality and packaging is awsom"
"Sound, bass, comfort and additional accessories are great but the left ear's unit stopped working after 4 months of usage."
Got for it with out hesitation.
I am using this earphone from 2 years. Best quality earphone. Tangle free and sound quality is good for this range.

 Nice product sound very good
the sound is less good when we talk to me using this laptop
Boat logo came out. Please pack the product in full safety especially electronics items
One side of the ear phones will be damaged as time passes. Please don't buy this product.
It is a good product for rough used purposes
Quality is bestI used for bgmi and is best and quality over price is finestJust if wire quality improves it will be the best earphones
It’s been 1-2 week now it’s good according to prize .. value for money this product …I purchase this at 399rs.
"Value for money, but noise cancellation is not up to the mark... In almost every boat earphones, I faced the same problem. Overall this is a good choice..."
good and price is also good
"It was really when I bought it, but it definitely won't last long enough, not even for a year. After use of 4 months. one side of the speaker stopped working."
"Audio crackles up everytime I plug it in. The instrumental part of a song is only audible , the vocals are muffled up like watery audio."
Sound quality is good
"I surprised, really good sound & bass quality. Value for money..  Obviously go for it.."
                    The media could not be loaded.

Nice Quality as expected from BoAt ... love this brand.. nice color combination
I love boat products as always and product totally awesome buying this product is totally worthit
It's awesome very nice sound quality 😘😘😘
"I am using it over 3 months having no problem at all . sound is clear and louder (bass is moderate).i got this for rs 449 so far so good plus it breaded wire is amazing ...,.."
The Product is awesome... It has it's own style & uniqueness... It let the user lift off the world of reality into the musically realm. Beware do not use it on roads or work place.
boat 242 product is very good but i think the side wire on the earphones got slightly pressed while packing
Over all the product is fine with good material used in earphone. There is a little bit high pitched voice with lower bass.
As I have purchased it with in 4 months of span I can hear Songs and all but cannot hear what the opposite person is speaking so it is totally barred
Nice
"Boat headset is rockerz... Sound quality Amazing, design is wonderful..... Very nice this products... 😍😍"
Good sound quality
"Bass is just extremely good and sound quality is amazing😍, one thing that lacks is build quality of wire🙃, everything else is top notch"
Good quality. Fits right in your ears.Less pain. Bass is really good for this rate. One of a fine product of Boat.
U can try it's products they r really nice but this one gave me headache
"One of the best Earphone in this price range sound clarity is just any expensive heaphones. ""ONE OF THE BEST EARPHONES"" 100% recommended"
Wrost item . Amazon give uses earphone . One side speaker already damage and sound quality is very worst.
No bass at all. The name is just wrong marketing. Pls buy other product. Believe me u will be disappointed if u order this.
"Sound quality is really good for the price, the only issue that I am facing is regarding comfort. It's not very comfortable for long time wear."
I have purchased for connecting my laptop. Good product
Good product as per expectations from boat
Good quality product
I was looking for a midrange earphones and this earphone is upto the mark and best one in this range. Quality is excellent and it has grip so perfectly fit in ears.Sound quality is good.
Sound is ok. But ear buds quality is not upto the mark
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
Trust me I've used and using it currently. In my opinion it's the best quality u can ever get in this price. Seriously boat is very close to my heart. It's bass is fab. Everything's coll about this headphone. Worth buying.
Sounds good 👍
Poor quality
Sound Quality is good in this price range. It is available for ₹399 in Sale period. Overall a good bang for the bucks.
"Sound quality is good upto certain volume, bass is good as per the price and due to the attachment, ears start paining after using for long time, so overall product is good."
NICE ONE
Sound quality and build quality is good. Worth the money
Yeh earphone best hain JO PUBG URF BGMI KHELTE H UNKE LIYE BEST h is price m  bass quality bhut is awesome h built quality bhi bhut badiya h
Actually if you want this for jogging and exercising i would say yessBut if you want this for normal use i would say noBecause your ear starts hurting after' a while
"As a trainer, i find it comfortable engaging long hours."
Worth for the money. Recommend to all buy.
Worst experience because within 10 days it have a disconnecting issue and one of the ear plug have no sound... worst worst ever product...😡
"It is very strong earphone, especially it's sound quality and durability. It's been more than three months and I am using it daily n still working nicely."
Bad product. Build quality is not good. Earpieces will make your ears hurt. Sound quality is also bad. Not recommended at all.
At pricing it's awesome .
It's just awesome for gaming(bgmi) or pubg  and not only for that and music ...totally very good
"Perfectly boosted bass and good compatability with all androids worth the penny spent.sound quality is perfect,noise cancellation can be little more improved.overall it is good and worth."
Everything is perfect in this earphone except the mic in my case there is some issue in mic. And if I'm paying 500 I want product which is perfect in call or on video cl or for listening songs.
Good sound quality and nice earphone design. Best earphones in this price range.
Stopped working after 4-5 months.Its not the first earphone that has stopped working after few months so ill suggest if anyone want a good lasting product then go for some trusted company.
"As what is described in description about the product, really does not match with the product received"
Got ruined within a couple weeks.There was no physical damage. Just stopped working.If the product can be replaced then please do.
At first few weeks sound is Awesome but after 2 weeks sound quality droups .
Great work by boat ensuring the clearity of sound and powerfull bass more than bassheads 225 and build quality is good also
Good
Whenever i am calling to someone.. the voice is not clear it got breking in the middle of talk.. very disappointed.. !!
Quality and grip are damn good. Doubted whether it fits in ear properly or not. But it's just perfect. Perfect earphones at very reasonable price.
"The use plastic is more in it, and if touch on it it feels like lower quality plastic is used, build quality I'll give 3/10"
Have minor sound issue as connection cord is loose
Good
"Sound Quality is good, Bass is also decent enough, volume control is helpful if you travel in crowded transit with mobile in pocket."
Good
All ok but a part of my lead fell off I it is not looking good  I hope it will be replaced cause it is having its one year warranty
You can consider it on sale below 450( free shipping) awesome in this price range
Awesome
The sound quality is pretty fine and clear. However the bass isn't as impressive.It's pretty comfortable on the ear.Good deal for the price.
It is worth to buy. No other brand could beat this earphone at this price.
Product is good. But price went down after purchase.
Alright sound quality
Quality excellent
"I expected a high definition bass but is normal like a other headsets ,no proper base to the music, I recommend no to this product"
Superb value for money 🤑
If you are looking for good built quality then don't buy but sound quality is goodGo for boat 225
Good Product you can buy black colour earphones.Don't buy to prefer green colour earphones after sometimes you will get ear pain.
Badiya
It's a truly good product at the price point
Value for money
Sound quality is not value for moneyBuild quality and design are excellentBut they compromise with sound quality i don't know why
"MOuth is not working and.., when it is working other side they are hearing lot of noise though no noise from my end."
Recommended
My phn is real me 3 and Jack of this phn is not fitted in my phn .....sound Quality is not adequate......
"Bad product, I had used only for 2-3 month only and it got damage automatically, first one side got damaged then both."
Bakwas
Very nice sound. Worth buying
"mic was not working properly when I bought it..Earphone was making noise when 2 mobiles nearby..Also after 2 months, its mic was not working..dead.."
"If I took this handspree on 24th December, I would have given a 6 month warranty. Now I don't get any side noise"
Amazing product at this price.... Quality is far better than 1500 range even...
"So far it's a good product. Don't know how long it's gonna last. Comes with extra rubber buds, which is a good thing."
Impressive in given price point...
Everything about the headset is more than satisfactory. Clarity noise cancellation it's got everything.
"Good headphone from boat,I am using this for month up to this no problems."
Too much treble wrt bass. Unbalanced sound.
Quality is not that good. The small coverung foil is detached from ear bud..
It did not met my expectations...music and sounds is noisy..bass is dominating music..un clear music ..but good at gaming..
Split cables are thin otherwise best
"Awesome quality, wire quality is nice, sound is loud and clear, bass is good, ear fit."
After 30 min feel ear pain
Value for money product. I have purchased it @349 so I'm totally satisfied with it.And Boat name is enough
Really worth to buy.
"The quality of sound is not good as we expect,. Bass is to low,.  The previous boat earphones are very good as compared to this earphone,"
I like this products. Use this for online class & listen song🎵. Sounds quality amazing👍😍😍  Always my favorite earphones🎧
First day it's good ....After some day it was going very painfull in ear .......like helll....Don't buy it
Overall a good earphones with in low budget..Base and sound quality is best and good earphones for gaming too...
"Extreamly good,im weiting this review after 1year and this earphones still work completely fine and great"
"Actually I bought this for my online classes  ,,,as a best company produce best products only ,,,,,but my choice is this one is best"
Nice ! As brand suggests 'quality product'.
Worst product
The products look very good its What to buy for the price which is given its comfortable the sound quality is good build quality is also good
Full base at lonely place....in traffic and bike riding no use....but at home or bus or car or something else it is good...and wire quality are so good..
Sound quality is good build quality is also good button working soo don't attend phone call in your headphones
VALUE OF MONEY
Sound doesn't distort that much at high volumes so it's good for Rs 450
value for money
Product has decent voice quality ( as per rate) however product durability is really low. Color is coming out in two months. Even the plastic at wire joints broke
Nice and quality product from BoAt....The cable was well made and the sound quality is fine..
Sound quality is not so good. You will regret after buying it that you must had searched for another ones. Mi basic are better
I am still small disappointment for this product.The mic buttons like volume button and call attend button not working with one ago.
Sound quality awesomeVolume awesomeAnyone can easily go for it.. Trust me it's great..Value seems costlier by around 50bucks..Overall the best within ₹500 to ₹1000 range.. Better than JBL or Skullcandy or any other..
Its been just 5 months since i purchased the product. Now the mic is not working. I am unable to use it for calling purpose.
Using it from last 1 month. Bass is ok but Very high treble. Search and try another
Boat..just the name no need to think twice..at this price(I got it in 399) its just awesome
Great earphones.... Look so good...noise cancellation is amazing and sound quality is top notch.
Second time i am ordering the sameMost underrated headphones.Just buy it.Amazon Delivery is so fast.Within one day
Kuch din ka khushi chahiye toh lelo 2 month ke badh Wahi 100 rupaye wla earphone mai transform ho jata hai yeah
"I loved the item, sound is great, Also has separate volume rocker and mute button. Love the color too"
Excellent sound quality
"One side of earphone is not working, please tell me what should i do.And this product is in warranty also"
Awesome bass
The headphones are pretty good but are big in size due to it the ear begins normally paining and it's bass and sound quality is good but it doesn't have a good grip on your ear
"great sound and, noise cancellation even helped me sleep during exams 💀💀 thank u for that ❣️"
Good for normal use. I am not satisfied with the product as I am not able to change music with the buttons. Zero noise cancellation. Only good for calling purpose
"Bought  few months before, but the quality is not upto the mark and all of the sudden one side of the speaker is not working..."
Nice one
Not good enough for the price
242 cannot beat 225. Bassheads 242 is ok. Not that good as compared to Boat earphone 225. There is difference of approximately Rs100/-. But it is worth having 225.
The person over call can hear everything in the background clearly. If noise cancellation is improved the product is really good and worth the money
Excellent Product ! Good sound quality and fits properly to ear !! Must buy !!
Very nice and sturdy. Beautiful. Sound quality is very good.
Very good quality... worth for the money paid.  Highly satisfied.
Nice quality earphone
Don't buy this product ... one side of earphone stopped working less that 2 month and the their warranty service is also worst ...
It's really very good and funky and trendy in color.
Best buying
Decent product quality . Better to hear only with 70-80% of volume.. feels pain on ear for long use ex: watching filmsAnyway happy with the product ✌️
Very good product. I am using it for 4 months quality if sound is very good. Bass very good. Surround sound best experience. Worth the money.
Nice product with superb bass quality purchase it and enjoy / this product is better than with comparing Bluetooth buds √ buy it
Ok for calling. Music lovers may have better choice.
Sound quality is good.It will cancel max noises from surroundingsBass quality is also good

"Superb product which I bought from Amazon, I waited upto the lighting deal and I bought for ₹450.Rhe sound quality is good,base quality is superb 👍👍👍👍"
"Fantastic sound quality and good Bass and super strong quality,  Must buy without a think."
Over All Product is Awesome..Loud Sound with Average Bass..Nice Quality Wire...Not Tooo Good or Tooo Bad... Good Choice In This Budget 499
You can't listen with it more than a minute you will feel pain I'm ear after using...
Carbon black colour is not good
For listening 🎧 music is best but not for gaming to much of bass
Very good must buy nice sound quality and build quality
Value for money and very good product. 👍👍👍
"I actually paid only 230rs for this earphones amazon pay gave me 169 rs cash back. product is amazing, build quality is amazing."
It's good for me. Comfortable in ear sound quality also very good. I think the rubber part to fix in the ear slightly loose after somedays of use but it's no problem with.
The sound quality is too good clearNo extra bass but good  I use boat 225 still there is more Bass and clean
Best headset. Since last 10yrs i used headset this one is the best one in it...
Sound Quality of the earphones is too good bass is also good
Good product in quality wise but by adding simple ear rubber supporter worth ₹100.This is totally wastage of money...
Very bad totle all
"Bought it 3-4 months ago, worth the money."
very bad.. worked only for one month..and i have warranty for six month. ..but there is no option for exchange
Sound quality was not as expected. But if you are looking for hardy earphones then go for it. My cat tried very hard but could not damage the cables.
Best handsfree under this price segment. This sounds better than my sony headphones. Sound quality is crystal clear and bass is also super.
"Catalogue to be specified with "" How to wear this earphone with pictures "". Beacuse this earphone is not easily fit it."
"I love the headset, it looks amazing, the noise cancellation is excellent, also the wire is flexible and sweat proof to use."
Best with in that price range
Sound quality is great and soft
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
 ear Phones are not there in package.That to warphones package is opened
Good till now
Strength is really appreciated. After being to harsh wear are tear. Its intact in his shape size and sound quality. Best Earphone used til now.
Nothing to say 100% perfect value for money
"Sound quality superb 🙉 , very nice very satisfied for this , thanks too Amazon ."
Good for the people who love to have huge bass
This is the best earphone under this prize rangeI have 2 of them in different coloursAnd I love it
Actually if you want for bgmi then it's good choice but if you can spen 200 more then go for spinbot earphones
Very good sound quality & bass aswell
Worst headphones...not sure even if they are original because the colour is fading quickly and the ear buds they are horrible
"Nothing can match its sound , nobody comes even near to it.Reviewing after more than 1 month usesJust excellent"
Audio - 4/5Mic - 4/5Bass - 3.5/5Built Quality - 3.5/5Overall for ₹399 it's the best earphones ✌️
Left side stopped working after 2 weeks for me.Never even dropped the earphones once.
The product is good I like the design bestSound is OK can be use while work out and gaming
"As always the product is good with low budget and the bass quality is excellent.Love this earphones, highly recommend."
Simply one word. Excellent.
don’t waste your money to buy this
The wires are really thin.
I cannot hear perfect footstep sounds.. It is actually not good for gaming..  After Long term usage it will make little pain in your ears
Very good product from boat
"bass is at its best, and noise cancellation, fitting of ears, lightweight. everything is perfect. loved it."
Worst earphones just like 80rs in market no bass full noise you will get ear pain.... Even though a little expensive Better use sony 850rs earphones full bass and clarity
After using for 20 to 30 mins ears are paining because for its design
Not that much good.... really i am not lying and if you don't believe me you can buy it and see your self. Then you will say that I was right.
The packaging was soo worst but the headphone was GoodPls make sure that ur next packaging to the next customer is good thank you
Good buy
Sound clarify at an appreciable level. Controls are working on Android phone. Overall worth its value.
"Good sound quality, no problem while using headset , there is no irritation for long time use ..it overall its good product"
"Good, but too early to give comments on performance"
"Excellent, giving review after 5 months of usage."
The design is awesome . This fits right . The only problem is microphone is bad when connected in computer . The sound quality is very good  and bass is also good
Good product for the price..  fits perfect in ears and sound clarity is good.
Expected a performance from this product but it didn't live upto the mark. Return window is closed otherwise would've returned it.
Like
Don't buy this headphones
Recvd today i think best product in the category of wired headset so you can buyBut only one thing it pains after long use but it can be beared😇
It's worth for the price
Bought it a few days ago. Amazon order arrived in just one day (not a prime member).The headphones have a clear crisp sound quality. The bass is alright... Not great but not bad either.
Product is strongly disliked as althogh jack was broken all on a sudden BOAT refused to replace hence this product should be avoided to buy
"If you're looking for a very good quality headphone under budget price, go for it....You won't be disappointed."
One of the fine quality among substitute
Worth for money
My son liked it
Nice fit and built quality
Ok for daily use. Bass is low. Volume is low. Tangle free. Stays put in the ear. Clear sound though not classy.
"Plz don't purchase boat products , getting very  difficulties to Replace in warranty Period.  Lots of time i went at Thane Service centre . Now I feed up."
The product is really good. Sometimes it's mic can't receive low sound. Build quality and durability is good.
"Wire is strong, sound is loud"
Earphone sound quality are excellentEarphone wire quality is also excellentGood earphone under 500 price
Ear plugs could have been made better
"Left ear phone is not working , i didnt seen the product for a days so i kept it like thatno use of product"
"The mic is not up to the mark I have to hold mic exactly in front of my mouth , otherwise the person I am talking to will not be able to hear me."
This Earphones are very good in sound quality.I use it continues for 2-3 hours with comfort and without pain in my ears.
I'm using this from past 8 monthsAt 1st it's was the best earphone but now sound quality was worst at right side & left side is fare enough for deaf peopleBcoz it's not working
This product is awesome.Quality is excellent. I am a happy customer.
Earphone is comfortableBass 9/10Sound quality 9/10Comfortable 10/10Noise cancellation 9/10Overall very good earphone
Worst earphones i have ever used value for money but if you pay 100 more you get realme buds 2 which are way better than these earphones
Best in class earphone . Thanks boat
It is an amazing headphone....sound quality is at its best... Controls are effective.....10mm drivers are powerful with bass which is known for BOAT
More sound comes from the left side of this headphone and a little less from the Right side.
"All are super.After use of 15 days, ear mic and buttons are not functioning."
Fantastic
Go for better brand or atleast better model of this brand. This one looks nice but perform average
Sound quality is fantastic however the volume buttons don't work. Even if I try to reduce the volume it keeps increasing rather than lowering it.
Osm earphones in this price segment. I must suggest to buy this because in this price u can't get Better than this.Bass quality -5/5Sound quality-5/5 superb soundNoise cancellation is also good.
Quality is good however it hurts ur ears when u use for more than an hour or so....rest worth buying
"Good product 👍For 499 RS , Best earphone in price range and sound quality is too good with decent bass in low volume."

Good sound quality. Comes with a small pouch and extra earbuds. It has volume control buttons. Overall a good decent deal.
Good effect but i felt background noise cancellation is less.
I have bought headphones. I was replaced the item because during call disturbance is being heared in receiver end. Same issue is being observed in replaced one also.
"Th bass is good ,vocals are not bad either ..if you are  into music that has a lot of beats and bass go ahead and buy this"

"For Phone the sound quality is good and worth the cost, But it's not working on my MacBook Pro."
Product looks good works good. But material used is not value for money. Basically a delicate product for the price of 499.
Bass Quality os next level + The smoothness is outstanding.
"Sound,Noise cancellation and Bass quality same as boAt225 model. Bought @399+50 shipped."
This product is worse. No audible sound within 1 hour of use. Seems manufacturing defect.
Bade and audio quality is good but not noise cancellation but at this price point it’s a decent buy
"Sound quality is very poor, noise cancellation is not effective and bass quality also poor .Wasting money buying this earphone (242 based heads)."
"Auto button work,when I talk from call auto mute, volume low,high and call ended.And some auto Play music and stop😡😡"
It stops working after 4 months 😑 the wire was damaged and right side earphone was not working 🙂
soud problem after 1month
Not good
"Sound is amazing, output in base also excellent, no sound lagging, break, and cut in quality of music.. 101/100.."
Excellent
Customer service is very badOne side not working after 2nd month of purchase very very rude response from the service center customer care
Good at this price
The Sound Quality is quite good.But  the main thing is it doesn't tangle like the other headphones.Atleast you don't have to worry about that🤣🤣.
The product is good for the price but noise cancellation is not upto the markDon't overthink just go for it
Too good to use for exercise+ had a lovely sound quality.
"I did not face any problem till now ,it has good sound quality, and is perfect for my requirements."
product is good and the sound is good the earphone is the good
Best earphones under 500 bas is best in class audio  quality is also decent treble mids highs are best you can go for it if you need best bass
I just got the product delivered. I have opened the package and tested the product. Left earpiece is not working. Got the damaged product.
The phone doesn't even detect the mic. Volume button and pause button are not working. Extremely dissatisfied on the first usage itself
Bought this earphone again...as I lost my earlier one during travel..
I like the colour of the product I use this product.
"Nice quality.  Bass is good,  sound quality great as per price range."
Nice products
"I expected more bass from this,, but treble is more which cause painful in ears at a high volume....."
"Quality  is not good, I have returned."
"I buy this from amazon last 3 month ago,Sound quality is good with good base but I m very disapointed to its bcz its mic not working right now ...plz return or repaire amazon."
Sound quality 👎Bass haha how even can boat askNoise cancellation good
"Finally I received the product...one of the best earphones.. It is very useful for pubg players, Escpially sound quality is awesome..... Very fast delivery by Amazon"
Build quality is very good 👌.The sound is also good.

 Overall GoodAfter two months broken
Super TO PLAY PUBG awesome with DOLBY ATMOSS....nice build quality....but noice cancellation is not good as expected
I didn't receive Warranty card in the box. Only a boat products catalogue is there. Cable is not braided or coated. Are these earphones even original?
Not buying
The product which they sent 1st had many problem so had to get it replaced. Headphones are good but not up-to the mark. When it is a boat brand headphones expectations always be high.
NA
"Too good, have been using it for almost a year now! Got another one too for my mom."

"Best quality, everything is good about this. Value  for money. Writing this after 15 days of use"
Nice sounds great
"Ultimate product, perfect working,super sound quality."
My earphone is not working once sound comes and next moment it goes while moving phone.It's under the warranty period so what shall I do could you please tell me but the product was awesome
"Best at this price, original product. Go for it"
Bass is not superb but nice bass. Sound quality is nice.But if you are bass lover than you can also go for REALME EARBUDS 2 (₹599). It has awesome look n finish.You can go for it
"I like this brand so much I trust this product's quality blindly love this brand so go and buy this as soon as possible ""sound quality """
"It's Just Awesome , Go For It ...I bought it at 499/- in offerBut Sometimes on bigger offer Amazon gives it at 399/-"
"Sound quality was Awesome, built quality was very good, perfectly fit in ears, over all nice experience"
"The product is upto the mark. Noise cancellation is an issue, bass is also quite good but not like JBL headphones. But overall reasonable product at this price range..."
In rs 499 its good.. bt all over not good. Look like a cheap quality
"One side of earphone was not working , thats y i applied for RETURN just after 15 minutes of getting the order."
"It is exactly what I saw the image on Amazon. Worth the price.. I am happy to use it, it is sleek, HD, voice quality is very good. Thanks much"
WORST...WORST...WORST.....SOUNT QUALITY WAS WORST..............
just bad
Sound quality is average and not more loud as we expected fr brand
"Sound and bass quality is really awesome. Noise cancellation is good but not great. Considering the price point, it's ok."
"100% original product, with good sound quality and comfort. Gifted to my husband and he liked it very much. Thanks"
This thing is a very bad quality one. It's Mike is very bad while making call it makes lot of disturbance (noise)due to which other person cannot hear properly in the conversation.
Best sound quality 🔊 best' Beas 🎷 qualityAchi
Good product.. NO Noticeable problem till date..
Not good average sound quality.
I didn't expected such a low quality product from BOAT.  There are more reliable products and more quality driven earphone at same price tag
Usually it stops working within a month and i had claimed replacement for it 2 times and now I'm gonna return it 3rd
Looking like duplicate product. Totally not satisfied with quality of this earphone. Amazon should take care about 1st copy products
Bought it for second time.. They seriously have degraded the build quality... I don't recommend it anymore..... It has really thin wires in comparison to the previous one i used....
Useless in the long run. Not a single one of the boat earphones I bought lasted at least an year.
Very effective
Good but not suggesting anyone
The product was previously used by some one else .
Ears are paining due to hardness
The earphones are fine at the price range. Although I find that there is a no bass in this earphones. Other than that it is very good.
Waste of money... No Mike you can't attend calls on it only for music...  And don't expect sound quality...
Perfect product.
Every time I purchased Boat Earphone it get damaged within 4 to 5 months.  Please save money.  Don't purchased their products.
Worst product. Very uncomfortable to wear. Mic quality not good. Very bad product. Don't allow return as well. Gives headache too.
"Very high pitched Bass. Bassheads doesn't compromise on sound quality for high volume. If you are reading this, just go for it. Very satisfied.P.S One bud stopped working already even after perfect care.  No longevity."
Bought this earphones for the second time worth the price
"Excellent product and it have 1 year warranty so use... #bindass🤙Great bass, look and durability. 🎧"
one of d bestest available in market...value for each n every penny spend on it ...
"Worst earphones, in just 2 weeks right earphone speaker stopped working properly"
Only issue was we can't use it for a longer period in a day.a little bit pain  when it's used for more than 4-6 hours.
The ear jacks are not friendly.it is hurting
Good but the earphone bud net is not good overall good 1
Best ever product from Boat. But also go for boat basshead 103 if you have budget from 300 to 399.
Quality of the sound is good but built quality can be improved ear piece can be small and soft after sometimes of use it give pain in ear
Sound quality was so goodNoise cancellation was superbBass was excellent
Super bass ...super sound ......
Osssum product nice bass trable.Feel like branded headphone. And mic quality is also good. The noise cancellation of mic is too good.
Thnx Amazon for such a fabulous and fantastic deal
A Super Buy. Great product.
"Sound quality is average,, design is not suitable for ears.... Ear hurts when plugs in for long duration"
Excellent
Average.. Realme are much better
Stylish and superb sound quality. Just Go for it.
"Earphn Quality is good but after 1 month , one earphn stops working ☹️☹️Dont buy please 🙏 waste of money I think"
"Good quality, lacks little base and pitch too high. Would be better if noise cancellation was on little higher side."
In one week stop working one side
Sound quality and Bass Quality is good 👌 Excellent product
Build quality seems poor and it even smells wierd due to poor storage.They dont give refund so use only if tight on budget.
"Ears are paining when continuously wearing for ,more than an hour. The reason is outer body is little bigger."
Sound quality is good with booming bass and good quality of wire.
Goid quality. Deep bass. Satisfied with the purchases.
Product is awesome. No doubt.

Decent sound quality in i get in 350 inr.
How to get it replaced by another one since it is not working . It was used only in mobile
Good earphone as per price bracket but the mic was not good. Stopped working within 5 months of purchase.
It's good for music but if are using for calling purpose then voice breaks most if the time as well you will get ear pain in sometime...
Previously i used boat bassheads 225.there is no comparison between these two products when i bought that product it was the king of bass now this is the king of bass
"Hello I ordered the item on 5th April and today on 17th May, it has stopped working. I want another earphone and return this item"
It's an ok product at this price can't expect more.  If you want good sound quality go for other brands.
Thank you so much my favourite Shark Mr Aman Gupta
Audio and bass are good but the build quality is not it same as 100 rs earphones you get in local markets I don't they are going to last more than 6 months
"Dislike, one side speaker noise is not working left side( worest company) 🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕 just 20 days working. Money loss"

Super sound quality
I use this product on mobile and laptop.Its comfortable and good sound quality. Best for regular use.
"If you need a earphones for basic music listening and for calls , this is the one.  Its worth the money. I could buy more of these and give them as gifts. Its totally worth it."
Good bass effect. Good fit with spare buds. Headphones build is good. Can't use for a long time with the hooks tho. Bt worth it for the money.
Headphones are too good to use and voice quality is superb at this price.
Reviewing after few months. Poor quality headphones. Not expected from Boat
Nice Earphones......Bt not better then bout 152
"Ok ok product, should be far less than its price"
"Good prudut , but I felt bass is low in this, and vocals are good."
All things are good in this earphones but one thing is that there part was damage early.
"Ear Grip is good, material quality is very good and Sound can be improved to make it top class item among the available items in the market"
"Sound quality is good, noise cancellation is alright, bass is good...a little uncomfortable in the year..takes a little time to adjust"
I have been using it for about 3 weeks and one side is not working.....i will not recommend this product
"I like the sound quality in boat,and the price is also very reasonable"
Sound quality is good but there is problem while attending calls. There is always dual sound reflection. I have checked with different phones.
Good quality
Value for money.
"Quality is good for sound, but built quality gives up after 6 month, the rubber bushings out even often and it also results in ear connector coming out. Over all nice to use."
Bad product
"Though the cables are thin, but the sound quality is superb."
Nice product not bad worth for its price fit perfectly doesn't slip off easily
"Its not neon green its simple green, don't glow in blue or black light.So dont buy it for that point.😕"
I like bass and packing as well as warranty at this price range.

Sound is good and loud. Good one for long hour meetings.

Bass is very good and comfortable earpiece is this. price was that time 399 and I think in this price segment it is far better then others. I had JBL before and jow boat its very good like 1k price segment

Poor noise
Sound quality is good.  Cant use for long duration though. It causes pain in ear.
Best sound quality 👌.  Value for money.
Uncomfortable for long term usage.

Just an amazing earphone... Clear mesmerizing sound... With bass quality...jus go for it
Under this price you can't get any better
good purchase
the ear buds dont fit well and hurts the ears.
"Mic sound is too bad, incase of calls i always get a complaint voice is very low, inspite of keeping full volume."
Good Product
i bought 2 pair to earphones but both stopped working one in span of 2 months and one in a span of 2 and a half months
"Nice one, really good for money.."
Excellent
After 1 month I am giving review it was just excellent.
For the price compared to other earphones this one is simply the best for now. I am using this for a while so far so good. Go for it
Mic doesn't  work as expected
It's very good product and sound quality is good. I received boat headset bag also. it's nice. And one more thing it's Best Budget Product.
Bad bass quality .... As per reviews were given good .... But using them ... Sound bass is bad enough .... Loud music irritates ear .
Not good there has been lot of cost cutting in sound qualityIt gives pain in your ear when you listen to music at  40% volume.  Xd
The sound quality isn't very good. It's decent for normal tasks like taking calls but not at all good for listening to music.
Bass quality was good for only one week after one week the bass just flew away and there is only treble and treble nowPathetic earphones
"The clip was not provided as mentioned on the box  , even the box was half opend."
Little work on eartube
Item is not as described and poor quality.1. Sound quality is poor.2. Product itself Making lot of noise while walking.
This one is great pick in 450 to 500 range. No brand is nearer for this brand.
this is best ever lead I have ever used. They are soft and have very good sound quality with pretty much noise cancellation.
Really great earphones.
Not best but this price range is good
"Uncomfortable in wearing. Your ears will pain. Sound quality is ok but the base is pathetic.Mic is not good, will not recommend for calling purposes."
"Wire quality impressive, sound quality decent with worth of amount, but no extra buds are provided so little disappointed ."
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
 This is for a bass lover a perfect budget earphone for music love r
Waste of your money don't buy this product. Buy some other brand earphone can't even work properly after few days.
"I used it since 1 month but i doesn't face any issue, everything is good and I recommend u go for it"
"Stopped working after 1 month , first left earphone stopped and then after 3 days both stopped working . Worst from boat"
Good
"Good quality, trendy look easy use"
Dont buy......... very bad quality....Wire torned in 10 days.. poor quality
Not worth buying the earphones don't play properly on both sides after a month's time
"Sound quality is very clear, bass is very good. Fits perfectly in the ears without any pain. Build quality is awesome."
Bass and noise cancellation is good but sound quality is not worth it

"There is nothing to dislike, it has clear and awesome bass, awesome sound quality....superb look and the water proof quality. Overall 10 on 10😲💓👌"
Got the same product as ordered. The sound quality and bass quality is absolutely worth at this price. It is good for gaming also. If u r a music lover I prefer these headphones.
Superb quality. Low price. Really Amazon in India ka Apna Dylan.

Decent product at this price..
I am using this product from 1 year and ...i am proud to have this product....fully satisfied
Best wired earphones under 600. Sound quality is best and wire is very flexible. Easily compatible for most of the Mobile phones.
I have ordered 2nd one after a year. These are super earphone and has good quality output. I personally waited for these to return to stock and ordered it. Working super fine.
Sound quality is good..And product built well.
"Excellent sound quality, deep bass."
Quality is best but they gave us returned product.I received break and open box.
Product is good . Wire is coated with a  plastic material which prevents the wire to get damaged
I ordered this ear phone but within 2 month I face a 🎙️ problem so I sent back but I didn't get any information from company side
Quality is OK... Its a OK product...
Everything was good in this flagship earphone but i received the earphone with damaged ear-cap of the left side. You can see the attached photo. Looks like goat chew the ear-cap in the shop or go-down.
Top class bass with awesome treble and crystal clear Vocal its truely Awesome Overall one of the best earphones under 500
"I have got defective piece only one side listening but bass is very high voice, music clarity very much bad i was not expecting from boat brand..."
"Not good , I did not find anything great about this product to that price range ,it's not comfortable in ears"
Audio quality is good..... But the pause button doesn't work......I have replaced the product for 2 time by facing the same issue..
Easly fits in ears. Getting good quality sound & bass also.Cables are very very thin.
Right side headphone not working.
Friends its a very good product....try it once..the bass quality is awesome ....mic is also good...so take a taste of hard bass through it😘
must try
"Well I bought this for playing pubg, no lag issue, Sounds great .bass quality average. Manufacturing quality great"
Sound quality very bad. Not fit in ears properly.
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
Left side is damaged in inside... Very poor quality of earphone... Don't buy this.
It is a very good product but the buttons are not working properly.I think it will not for more than than a year.😐
I am facing issue in sound quality and when I called to someone they can't hear my voice clearly. Please replace this product.
Sound quality is super....!!
When ever I listen to songs that time it's prickle my ears. But in this range earphone for my opinion it's good
"The treble is terrible, Bass is good, great noise cancelation. Overall its a good product. Honestly I've bought worse earphones is this price range.."
"Likes- the reliability of the product, as personally I fumble a lot which practically means I break lot of stuff.Dislike - the notice cancellation part"
The product worth the price and onlg default is I got orange instead of blue.....but the product is amazing
Bought on 20th dec. And the sound stop coming from right side earpiece. Not durable
Creates a lot of distorted sound even after replacing it
Sound quality is good. But build quality is poor. Not recommended for rough use. Can be used as a backup headset.
Don't buy this head sets this cause more pain to ears after 5 to 10 min sound quality is good but it hurts my ears a lot
Very good quality at this price
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
 Good sound quality and build quality! Satisfied at this price!
One side stopped working in two months
"Mic issue.. after 2months of regular use, it started having issue with mic"
Excellent
Boat earphone is not good in build quality and the sound is ok ok.
I bought this months ago and i m very happy with my purchase.Sound quality is awesome 😊. Nice product with affordable price.
"Packing,product sound quality,sound effects on 8D,16 D  & voice quality on calling are EXCELLENT & comfort to use.Looking for long time use update review later again."
I use for pubg and such a great product plz dont  see negative review use it own then you feel about good or bad product 😎
Sound quality is awesome and looking good.
Mine was broken exactly after 30 days where I am not able to return it.. Worst product..
If you are willing to spend a bit more you can go for boat basshead 255. Very plastic product.
Its very best product from boat...high bass best noise cancellation....very good earphonesMust buy it easy to fix in ear
Excellent quality
"Within Indian Rs. 500 this is a good and worthy product, but I found not every 242 Bassheads has plastic coted wire which gives longevity."
The sound quality did not meet my expectations and my ears hurt if I put them on for a long time. If you are looking for better sound quality go for some other boat products
Vocals are clear when music is played but overall sound is low.
"badhiya h bhai lelo, bus clearity jyada high level toh h ni, lekin iss price m theek h."
Good bass crispy vocal
BASS + SOUND + NOISE CANCELLATION + PRODUCT QUALITY GOOD..ITS OKAY FOR WORTH OF RUPEES ON DATE OF 20-12-20..
Nice earphone to buy in this budget.
"Awesome sound quality, bass is too good, comfortable in ear, there is a carry bag in box and also 2 pairs of buds,but colour is looking cheap"
Overall good. But little uncomfortable after 20-30 minutes of use.
LEFT SIDE EARPHONE  STOPPED WORKING IN FEB AFTER PURCHASED IN DEC 2019. NOW EVEN THE PHONE IS NOT RECOGNIZING THE JACK INSERTION IN THE SOCKET
The best ever I have heard
"I used both ,.It is not correct earphones for bass lovers ....dont buy it and go for realme buds 2 for bass in budget."
It's so bad that it's like I'm listening to some 200rs headphones... Nd i can't even return it 🙄😒
"I like it but , these ear phones i purchase December but now its not workingThese ear phones validity only 3 months i think.  So i didn't like it"
Ohhhh dear I just loved this masterpiece.This is like Chota pack bada Dhamaka.Never expected this masterpiece from boat.This is amazingly Superb.
Noice cancellation is so good and sound quality is amazing and base is outstanding .Over all best product.
I thought these won't tangle but it tangles even more than the normal once so a little disappointed.
Connectivity to bad & noise cancellation very bad
Quality is very poor I used just for 1 week and one side of earphone is not working
"Not comfortable . Not suitable for long time use  , ears hurts after a short time usage."
I had requested for replacement on 6August now it is has passed one week but no dispatch recipt how amazon given the replacement garranty even my request is genius and under the time.
It's button was not working and Sound can hear from 10mitere distance(Not have noise cancellation)
"Sound quality is good, but ear phone quality is too worst.."
Paise barbad Krna h

Nice sound quality.Good bass.A quality product and at a cheap price.

"product is really really good under this price best sound,base, treble, noise cancelling,also ip5x so comfortable.. that's awesome impressed by boat this time"
Loved the quality of wires  and the sound is superb. Highly recommended in wired category.
Awesome product in this price range !
The size. I needed small buds but this is so uncomfortable to wear. Since I can’t return it I will just add it to junk.
"Good Material, Good Sound, must buy product as compared to price."
Pls don't buy it. It stopped working after 2 months
"Absolutely disgusting. Ordered on May 23, received the next day and as of June 5 the mic has stopped working and Amazon refuses to replace"
One ear piece has stopped workingAnd wires has brokenNo bass effectNot at all good product
Left side stopped working after 4 months and the quality of sound also decreases with time.
One side headphone not working properly. sound quality very poor after 1 week use.
I don't like it this product
While running its continuously coming out from my ears so not satisfied with this product. Sound quality is not that good but its ok type.
Very good sound quality and comfortable to wear. Don't know much about bass so can't comment
Simply the best. They're loud and bass is punchy not gimmicky.
Nice product.. working fantastically..
Excellent sound quality🎶Best for sportsmen🏃🏻🏋🏻🚴🏻Value for money 🤑Best wired earphone of Boat ⛵
Sound quality and earphones are good but they mentioned extra buds Included  but they are missing......disappointed....🙄
Very good effect and have one year warranty
That sound is too horrible and with full volume we  can't hear the sound its too loud and irritating
Good
"Such a nice sound quality,bass within this range is just beyond expectation.But prolonged hearing may cause pain in the ear initially."
Waste of buying...with in 20 days one of the right headset is not working.... Waste of buying...
Good value for money
Excellent earphone. Sound quality is good. But product quality is doubtful. Very thin cables. Not sure how long it survive. Fine for this price.
I had an 6 months experience with it and till sound quality is best and build quality is awesome 😎
Okay .as per accepting not so much.Sound quality should be done much better than NOW.
Useful.
I used Continuously naa Ear full pain happening and also this model head phone not comfortable for listening 🎧🎧
"Thoda noise cancellation kam hai puri tarike se kaam nahi karta hai, sound ki quality average hai,bass v kam hai"
Bohat acha hai....agar budget earphones chahiye toh isko le shakte ho. Great Product 👌
The earphone plastic material was not that good....the left one broke in a couple of weeks after use...no complaints with the audio quality as such... considering the price point of this product.
"The quality is gud but it causes disturbances during my online meetings or classes, the disturbance is like static"
Really really a nice product worth each RSNoice cancellation is not there mostly noise isolation fits perfectly in ear even with out hook
Good product
"Althought worked really well, perfect sound , lasted only for a month. No signs of damage, yet simply stopped working. Waste of money"
It’s suites to attend the meeting from laptop. Good quality on cheap price
Good product in the price.
"Basic, functional, good design, decent quality - perfect if you're looking for cheap headphones"
"Sound quality is goodBass is greatBut if sound is high, then the bass and sound doesn't synchronise in sound.Noise cancellation is very good.Better than JBL and Skullcandy at this price."
Their warranty service is very very good.Which is beat every others company.
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
" Voice is clear, comfortable with ear."
Worst quality of Wire like even u bend it feel like it will break down...N one side was not even working... Worst experience ever with boat
No compromise in quality from boAt family. Just loved the product as its best for ear comfort and having good audio and bass.
"Perfect fit... Loved it. Thanks Amazon 😊Well yes, you get a carry pouch. There was a query about this so I made it clear.👌👌"
Nice when compared to JBL and basic earphones of sony
Great
Valuable product.. Amazing effect.. Really worth for the price.. 💯💯..!!
One of the buds tore after using it for like 2 weeks sound quality is good
"But seems the product is low quality. After a 6 month of usage, the cable is broken near to right ear piece"
As good as expected from Boat. Everything is awesome except the build quality.Overall a good product to buy in this price range.Got it for Rs.399!
Very good product very smooth to use best value for money
It is a fine headphone in this price range.
Need to improve jack quality apart from that everything is awesome about this headphone
"It's a good product in this range, go for it."
mic is not working plz exchange I use earphone for online classes but I can't use mic my voice is not going to anyone person
"Not working properly (right bud), I purchased on 13 March, it's 4 April. Don't bye this product."

Its nothing for dislike in this product it is a terrific one.Thank you 𝐀𝐦𝐚𝐳𝐨𝐧 for such a genuine product.
"Can control volume, noise cancelling, comfortable, and has a high range of voume..."
"Bad experience with this order, not good, in voice call or whatsApp call voice not hearing properly. From my end 0 out of 10"
This is really a good package. Only concern is its durability. I think the jack is very delicate.Sound wise its too good.Go for it.
Absolutely awesome for the price. Sound quality is top notch for this price segment and in fact even better than skullkandy/senheiser etc. For the price this one is last stop.
"Best quality headset. When I connect it with my Lenovo K10 note (inbuilt Dolby Atmos) WOW, I am amazed."
Sound quality is excellent but if you use for long time those buds will start irritating
With 3Month mike not working and speaker quality diminished. Help me with Boat Customercare number for claiming warranty
"As per as sound & bass quality concern, in this price this product is Sterling. U guys can purchase it instead of any unknown companies product."
Overall an awesome pair of earphones at this price range
"Good product . But lack of base kills it sounds Quality. Build is very good. Not heavy, and fit it in ear pretty good"
Product is useless I bought it on 27 Oct 2020 and within 2 months earphones is of no good.and that too when I use earphone once in a while..

Only two day life after that voice at all..How to judge...

This boat ear phone is very nice and sound is A1 I love this product really I give a full marks

Superb sound and Bass. Fast Delivery. And value for money. Iam full satisfied with boat
"Not that impressive, it does its job."
It's not a good earphone i i had pain in my ear the hook are so irritating and sound are like so travel
Earphones have better grip in ears.... Long use will get some ear pain. Other than that earphones is good product.
One ear piece stopped functioning in 5 months
It has the best bass at this price range....the product is just outstanding for500 rs....definitely go for it
After a while it gives a crackling sound or disturbance ...Pathetic...can't even replace or return it!!!

"Hey guys,I got these earphones and I used it thoroughly in every sense like I tested battery time, charging time,sound quality, connectivity,etc. So let's start with pros.Pros:This is a boat product so I expecting to be in great sounding and it did. It's sound quality is like best at its price segment and better than high priced product too.It fits into the ear like perfect fitting. It will not come out even you swing your head hardly.It has a decent look that doesn't even get noticed like very subtle.Its mic quality is also decent.And now for what you have come so farCons:It shows of having a battery life upto 8 hours but it doesn't giving even 5 hours of continuous use.Its bluetooth connectivity is also poor. It's connection get blocked by a single wall. That means you can't use it in your home but if you use it in open place,you will get a range of 10 m.Its mic sound get distortion at the other end when you are on a call.It got a very bad phrases which interupt your music which I heard most people are complaining.It got some bad software sync with your phone. Like you charged it, you are using it and it doesn't show a battery drop after use and you think that it giving a great battery life but its not. That level drop drastically like from 100 to 50 directly and then you think that its a defected piece but its not. So this is also a issue.And at last, when you are on call it cut little sound from the other side like blocking signals. Its the earphone issue.Now conclusion,If you want to get a great sounding earphone, go for 550 pro/sport which come at same price.All in one word, I am not recommending these as you can't buy this only for sound.And you can get my point from the above mentioned issues.Hope ypu liked the review.Thanks"
Completely satisfied with a product. Amazing song quality. Balanced at every aspect. I bought it for 999 and it is value for money. Very very comfortable for the users who like chill songs and use for a long time. Bass is not that much strong. If u r a hip hop lover I won't recommend it to u. Battery backup is amazing.😍😍
Good One. easy to pair. call was clear. Sound also vary good.Its not fancy as its completely black except the logo.BoAt is always value for money.
I started using these earphones in December  last year and it has hardly been 10 months of use and now there is no sound in the left earpiece. Batterylife was never great. Eventhough it says 1 year warranty it's  a SCAM. I have tried  calling the seller and visited the boatsupport website but no help provided by them.Kindly refrain from buying these.

 I 'm an Audiophile using SONY/B&O headsets for 7yrs now. I will keep this review easy to understand & non-technical :-🚩 BOAT is a confused Indian brand which is selling basically the same BT Headsets with slight exterior variations into many models !🚩 The BT 5.2 Connectivity is instant & hassle-free !  NO LAG/LATENCY as such. PAIR IT WITH A GOOD PHONE & YES YOU CAN PLAY  PUBG/BGMI. 👍🏻🚩 the Material Quality is Premium & the choice of plastic + rubber is very diligently used. The earcups snugs into your ears nicely.🚩 The Sound Quality is acceptable. Also the UNI-DIRECTIONAL Mic is loud & crystal clear during Calls 📞.🚩 Don't  expect Apple Airpods/Samsung Buds type of experience but the Sound Stage is decent. YOU GET WHAT YOU PAID FOR 👍🏻
Headphone is not working properly it said 1 year warranty but it did not even last for 6 months. Exact after 3 months I was not able to hear through the left ear piece and again after a month I couldn't hear thorough the right ear piece. Shitty product.
"Easy to sync and use. Audio quality is good and it holds the connection almost upto 10 meters. Good for calls, podcast and light music. Noise cancelation is decent. Not big on bass, not suitable for hip hop & Rnb."
"245 looks premium,it stays with you long if u just use it to attend calls and watch some short videos on the go.. but sadly it wont give you much backup when you start watching a movie,and u cant get some quick time on it if u just plugin for like just 10 minutes.. This fast charging is the greatest thing i have noticed in boat 235v2 even though it looks a bulky neckband with thin thread like wires connecting the drivers.."
Sound is good but price is to high i bought it 999 and its to expensive bouts rockers 255 better than this if buy this so i tell you dont buy see 255 is to improved I'm using 255 this product is but don't buy its like 599 rs product if you buying earphone please wait for sales and you buy 255 only 999 best deal waiting for Amazon sale
"After 2 week use,Good things:Good sound quality for the price.Problems faced1) Battery low warning starts at 40% battery level. One warning each at 20%, 10% and 5% would have been nice2) Battery life not as much advertised, almost half of that even at 40% of max sound level3) Battery drop suddenly towards the end and the headphone switch off4) Connectivity problem with many devices, intermittent bluetooth disconnectionOverall reliability seems a problem. Would I buy this again? No. Boat should get their headphone working stably first for the advertised period of operation."
"Excellent connectivity, OK sound quality. But batrery life is a concern.Edit 180421 after 2 month of use, the battery is near dead, it cannot hold even 1 hour after full charge. Mike is also very unreliable and forces me to frequently disconnect it to ebable to talk normally. I am forced to look for a different headset"
Good product. Bass is beyond average. Much better than other options in this price range.
I don't know who designed these damn buds...he must have been hight when he designed them...both earbuds have holes in them when we remove the earhooks...not everyone likes earhooks and theyr not replaceable...i always loved boat fir theyr value and quality...but this one im extremely shocked and disappointed....talk about cheap quality!! Even 500rs headphones dont have holes in them!!!!i guess this what happens when a brand get famous
"I agree that I bought it in good discount, but Amazon allowed only replace not return option means it you don't like it you are stuck.  Secondly as you may see in the images the Box was opened and tampered crushed totally, seems product is used for few days and it's evident that it's not a fresh one and product fit and finish is not that good sound is just ok bass is very low and worst part is the microphone it's feels like you are taking at a distance of 10-20 meters means low distorted voice and filled with surrounding noise. Don't waste your hard earned money here for skullcandy neckband instead."
"I am used to professional headphones with open back, like HD650 from Sennheiser. But for casual use when I am not in front of my computer or commuting, its a great earphone. Battery lasts a long time for me. Sound is great, actually better than expected, just don't expect in ear monitor quality.  Absolute steal for the price. Just hate those annoying phrases it says every time it connects to a device."
"Best sound quality at present time at this price rate .It is lot better than any other boat/JBL/One plus/boult/redmi/realmi buds/boss/Sony/Bluetooth earphone.And one of the main reason to purchase is that costumer service is the best of all times ,one of the best costumer service available in market"
"Never expected boat brand to come up with such products..This product has bluetooth connectivity issues. It's connection gets blocked by a single wall. That means you can't use it in your homeIts mic sound get distortion at the other end when you are on a call.It got a very bad phrases which interupt your music which I heard most people are complaining ,  it doesn't show a battery drop after use and you think that it giving a great battery life but its not. That level drop drastically like from 100 to 50 directly and then you think that its a defected piece but its not. So this is also a issue.When you are on call it cuts little sound from the other side like blocking signals. Its the earphone issue.I feel stuck after buying this. Posting this afer 2 months of usage"
Pros: It has very good battery life. It connects to two devices simultaneously. Connects to devices very quickly. I find the bluetooth range more than my other bluetooth devices.Cons: After using for a month experiencing disturbances in sound. While on phone calls experience occasional robot like sound.Will book for warranty support today. Updates about the services received after getting a resolution.
Wow !! That's what I wanted after my iphone earphones deadIt's very loud and best for music lovers specially for those who have habit of listening on full volume like meOverall Bass 3.5/5Trebel 4/5Bass punching 5/5Silent bass 4.5/5Loudness 5.5Clarity 4/5Bluetooth connectivity 5/5
Do not purchase the product.sound quality is average . hardware quality is cheap. if you little press earphone or walking or doing adjustment in ear you will get weird sound like sparkdo not buy if you think Boat is Made in India (it is made in chine)Do not buy if you think if the manufacturer name if enough for qualityGo for Infinity by JBL you will get better quality in same price range
"Initially a great product, it gave 7-8hrs battery back up, good sound quality, durable, charged reasonably quickly but now after 4 months of use the charging port cover came off and it is barely giving 4hrs of battery back up, that is very disappointing.i would like to see if I can claim the warranty if it gets worse."
"not about the quality this thing is not fit for ear. Both buds, now in my  ear my old nokia wired earphone its not disturbing my ear,i cant feel its rigid. A 10 year old ear phone making me feel good. I never compare  this with your item.Last time i used a local neck band.it cost only 300.  I loved it. The only problem was its battery drained fast. But it worth. Thats why i purchased this thing. And one more thing your brand name. I will use this thing some more days, because i lost my 900.good by boat."
"I used rokerz 255 pro of my friend and it was working perfectly with my laptop and mobile.So I purchased rokerz 245 v2 thinking it would be good atleast from sound quality, but it is not at all good. The mic input quality is very very not good.I replaced the unit once, but again the new one had very bad mic input sound quality. I checked with laptop, mobile, mic testing app etc etc.Sound output from speaker are just OK ok. Not good.If you are purchasing for teams call, mobile calls...I suggest go for 255 pro or higher"
"I have been using Boat products since it was just a small & baby company. And this time, for the first time I'm highly disappointed with it. These earphones are just sheer waste. Music, sound quality isn't everything. The mic should also WORK. I bought it for meeting purpose, the mic wasn't working, either the other side was just not able to hear me or the voice was highly muffled.Got a replacement, thinking maybe it's just a defective piece, after all it's boat & I literally have 3 other boat products! But no use. Mic was still a HUGE problem, not even gonna say how bad the battery, interface & Bluetooth range & quality is. Period.So, dear other customers, DON'T BUY IT.AND Boat guys, STOP FREAKING SELLING SUCH A BAD PRODUCT FOR YOUR OWN BRAND IMAGE'S SAKE.Thanks."
Quality ok.  But no response from boat team regarding warranty issue. I purchased on nov 2019.  After 6month one side bud not audiable. Now after 10 month both sides not audible.
"The headphones are cost efficient, I bought it for 799/- and these are the pros and cons I observed:Pros:Amazing bassSound quality is excellentMic is good, in calls the receivers can hear you very clearly.Cons:Takes a long time to charge around an hour and half.The design is uncomfortable for long wear.During exercises it doesn't stay on and slips from ears.Charge only remains for 6 hours of constant use."
"It is a golden piece of Premium member of boAt family. It looks premium and much more comfort to wear for longer period of time, especially for online classes or business meetings. It sound quality just Mind-Blowing!!!!! Like boAt headphone... (boAt headphones are quite better than this though...) But sounds like very much premium or something you are listening gives pleasures. You will definitely love it's sound quality. I using other boAt products thought it is quite good! I can't talk about battery because I haven't tested though its playback about 8 hrs approx. It has Bluetooth V5.0 which covers quite a long range without distortions. It's sweat proof thus ideal for gym or workout something. But you will love and you can go for it! Thank You!"
I used Boat for the first time earlier I was using all JBL products.I must say Boat is doing a good job by providing Good products at the price bracket.But particularly on this product when I put the earphones on my ears their is a cheap platic sound comes which is annoying every time and when you adjust then also it comes...Or else sound is good and Mic is also good no complaints.
"A decent review...I had purchased this earphone on 28th Feb 2021 and I'm writing this review on 12th July 2021..At first its performance was excellent.. Brilliant sound quality, longlasting charge and easy connectivity...After 3 months of usage, the one side was damaged and later it fell off...Now the another side also lost its sound...I love this brand and its perfomance but trust me this product isn't worth buying...!! Not a long lasting product... Thanks!!"
"I wouldn't recommend it. This is a review after 1 week of use.The Bluetooth keeps disconnecting sometimes, and even when connected, its only connected with the music and not Voice... So I cant attend incoming calls or talk during games.Even when Connected, it doesn't give audio output"
One side bud is not workingThis product is not value for moneyDont buy😞😠Wings bluetooth earphones is better than this.
"I'm sure I won't be adding much to what other people have said already, but I'm going to add a few things that annoy me with this headset.Call quality is average. The other person can hear me when the mic is in proper angles, but cuts off entirely if it encounters slightest obstruction in the mic path.The voice prompts are too long. They are annoying. When you're on a call and quickly want to connect to the headset, the long voice prompts make us loose part of the conversation. I don't care how less power those prompts consume but they are way too annoying, very less user friendly and creepy.Sweat resistant my a**! I'm literally editing this review from my gym. Slightest sweat and the buttons seem to absorb it and behave on their own and surely not accidental pressures or presses. And of you're following any online programmes, you'd never be able to follow them through let alone finish the session. Looking to buy this for workouts? Skip it!Build quality is average at best."
"Hello guys,So I have used this earphones for 2 days now and the review is based on that.First let me begin with overall quality, this product has superb quality for the price. Sound is good enough if you don't care about bass too much, so if you prefer bass you should see some other options too.Connectivity is not a issue... Connects smoothly to any device. It's comfortable to wear too.To speak of cons, the charging port has a annoying cover over it which makes it very uncomfortable to plug in.  Other noticable problem is that wrong battery percentage is shown, to know the battery percentage I had to repair each time... But it's doesn't matter much as in case power goes down you will hear a message, reminding you to plug in. Apart from that there is no other reasonable problem... Battery backup is good.Bought it for 800 rs during sale... It's really good for that price.Hope you all have a nice day.🙏"

                    The media could not be loaded.
                
 Product is good I not open yet this product.......I want to buy boat 330 but there is no option for refund that's why I replaced it and then I request refund.....so plzzzz strat refund policy
"I ordered this wireless Bluetooth because my office work is mostly on phone. it worked for 2 days perfectly but after that, I started getting issues while I am on call or connecting the call. So I requested a replacement. It got replaced within 1 day but again I started facing the same issue with it. I always preferred boat earphones and never faced this type of issue. But not satisfied this time with these wireless Bluetooth."
"I was split minded between two products this and the infinity glide but ordered this since I had never used any boat products, was very sceptical because to me the brand felt like a cheap hype but i was proved wrong your quality speaks for your brand. I had been using focal and senhisser wired earphones prior though this is nowhere close but that wireless change does feel good for now. Overall i am happy with the quality and the product. It would be wrong on our part to be expecting a lot out of the price being paid. But i would assure you if you have any doubts go ahead and try it you will be surprised as me. I wouldn't want to compare this to any other product since i have no idea of it. I am happy with what i got, hoping this lasts longer."
1)The device is not shown in available devices many a times and if it is already paired it doesn't connect via bluetooth.2) it is made in china3) it doesn't connect even to Chinese phones4) it connects whenever it wants. No reliability when it connects. It was okay till return was valid. Now it's not even a month from purchase it doesn't connect 60%-70% of the time.I REGRET THIS PURCHASE
"The product is good , but the wires connecting buds with neckband is thin, and seems not so durable, it would be better if flat wires were used instead of normal earphone wires.Sound quality is best under this price range , bass is also good.Firstly played song : ""Naach meri Rani"", that sounds best with these earphones.Not charged them yet, as I got 100 % charged already inside the pack.Magnets are good but not so strong .Earbuds are soft, connectivity is also good , but after successful connection the notification sound ( that you connected successfully/ disconnected successfully) is of a men, not of a women like Google assistant or Alexa  ( Their voice are soft, sweet & cute also).Overall I liked the product, the only thing that I don't liked is the thin connecting wires( not flat wires) & the voice of men instead of women (off course that not matter a lot )I got these for Rs 800 in sale , and is best in this price."
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
 I like the most about this rockers is the noise cancellation. The sound quality is equally Good 👍 but while talking over call is sometimes difficult as in: The earplugs are a little tight and you will feel pain after sometime and a kind of echo is produced so you have to wear them little loose which will keep on falling from your ear and disturb you if you are on a call.
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
 Sound quality good cute colour worth it for this price and affordable loved it :)
A VFM PRODUCT bass is on heavier side which is normal on all BT boat earphones the battery life and grip is superb if u are ok with high bass these are the phones if u require balance sound then please go for Sony products
"I was using this earphone for 2 months from the last week of Nov 2021. Now thrown it and using my previous wired earphone. Why?Sound quality: Better at this price bandNoise cancellation: GoodComfort to wear: goodBattery life: Not the best but okThen what is the problem?The notifications. I am really surprised who has given this stupid idea to have such a lengthy dialogue for notifications, that too in French or Spanish (i do not know), such as Adios amigo etc.While you start connecting, it gives a lecture indeed. The battery low notification is the most irritating, comes every 10s or 20 s. Once the earphone reaches 20 % battery, you have to listen to that irritating dialogue almost half the time. You cannot continue your call at all. I am not sure if the designers have tested it. There is no way to disable it also.Battery life is not best. Hardly stays for 3 hours after 2 months of light usage. Battery notification has serious flaw. It shows 60 % at some point and suddenly jumps to 20 % directly (you are right! with the irritating dialogue). Should i grow my nail just for opening the charger port rubber lid? It is designed poorly. Either you have to have big nail, which i dont like at any cast, or use your teeth (yakk !.no way) or carry a tweezer always with your earphone.I have never imagined an earphone can have this much complications.Suggestion: If you still would like to buy this, please borrow from your friends (if available)  and use for a couple of days. If it still wins your heart, please go ahead."
"Was hoping if I could give this product 0 or -ve stars. Received this product a week ago and noticed that ""8-hour battery life"" Claim is FAKE. U have to charge the headset all the way to 100% or else they won't even last few hours. And then, as soon as it gets down to 50% , the whole battery drains down within 30 minutes. I have to charge it many times a day and it's very very frustrating.NEVER GOING TO CHOOSE BOAT EVER AGAINWORST PURCHASE EVERRR"
"I gave this a 4 star because it just doesn't fit my ears well. I'm a person who uses earphones for quiet a long time. I had pain after putting this on for a while. But overall, it's ome of the best earphones at this price. I think the fitting of the earphones can be different for different people. So, there's not much chance that you end up having hurting ears. But the quality really makes up to it. And you get a 1 year warrenty with it.  So, I think I'd recommend this to you."
Satisfactory product for this  price. I am not a great bass lover. for me it is ok. Some of the  sounds lack clarity. Overall product will impress you if you are not a great music lover. Just for casual use it is a good product.
"Pros1. Awesome battery backup2. light weight no neckpain3. Fast pairingCons1. Music quality Just normal , no impress, no bass , no treble. 1 more piston fit previously bought, 1 more greater than this. It's neckband ordinary sound headsetOtherwise everything is goodColour super"
"I don't know what is the issue with mic , Sound, bass, noice cancellation all are ok, even battry backup is also fine with this price, light weight,But the issue with me is when talking over a call voice gets slow down for the listeners not for me,, they are unable to listen a clear voice or loud voice, thats why i replaced rhe old one with new one andonce again the same issue has been faced by the person who is on the call on the other side"
"It screams out cheap and only magnet feels expensive nose cancellation is just the ear tips stufed  in your years and buttons are also not very responsive and sound is base heavy and calls also sound deep battery quickly drains and it stars to say""opps batty low"" after it goes under 30 percentage after every 5 min they hurt after long term use and make ears uneasy would recommend spending 100 500 rs more and get headphones"
Had great expectations from it as it was from boAt with 12mm drivers but the sound quality wasn't that great. Battery backup was very bad..after 50% it directly drains to 20 and in not time 10 then switch off. Very very disappointed so called the customer care in 2 days and requested for return.
"First of all. I had baught it for 899/- so its best at this range.Sound is crystal clear and is very good for songs, movies aswell as calling also.I told you on this pricing its worth but the features i miss is that we cannot see the percentage of charge anywhere only voice notification when its low.Auto off and on when magnets connects and disconnects is also a needed one.Noise cancellation is not in this oneBut at this rate its good"
"I was looking for a good pair of headphones that will suit both needs - listening to music and take calls/meetings. This set sadly fails very badly in the later.First impressions:Bad packaging - the headphones were pegged in a plastic tray like package. It is a different thing that the outer package itself came torn. But the headphones set in this plastic tray was just so hard to take out without snagging on the wires. Instead of having to pull on the cables, it seemed a better plan to cut the tray itself.Flimy - I have used an array of headphone and this one is by far the least sturdiest of ones. It does not seem like one that will last long.Things I like:It works with connecting to my music and podcasts and makes listening easy.The bluetooth has a fairly good range.Things I do not like:The charging cable is the worst possible cable around. It is barely a 3 inches long which makes it hard to charge at any and all points as the headphones will be hanging lopsided.It is just not designed to take calls and answer meetings. The quality of sound is just bad.It is not noise cancelling - it picks up the faintest of sounds and disrupts calls. Just not suited for all purposes.Bottom line:This set is over priced for the functions it does and the quality is just isn't there. If you are looking for something inexpensive and cheap, this might fit the bill. But nothing too great about the product. Will not recommend."
"This is a great product - IF YOU HATE YOURSELFHad no clue a pair of earphones could do so much to annoy you1. Sound quality is good for the price point, so if that's all you care about, go for it2. THEY HAVE THESE ANNOYING ANNOUNCEMENTS every single time you connect to them?!?!?!?! WHY? I CAN SEE they're connected, I don't need a 103-second announcement. And what's with the ""MAXIMUM VOLUME"" and ""MINIMUM VOLUME"" announcements? I get it, I changed the volume myself?! A simple beep would do the job?! Moreover, every time the battery is low, you'll get an announcement 10 times for that the battery is about to die out?! WE GOT IT THE FIRST TIME, maybe if you stopped declaring it, it wouldn't die out so soon 🤦 these phrases literally STOP your music instead of pausing them, which just makes bad things worse3. The battery life sucks, it goes from 80% to 0% in minutes4. It takes forever to charge, and I mean FOREVER5. It's flimsy af, so don't go for this if you're a rough user6. The magnet is really weak, and seems to be inbuilt just for the sake of it, it has no purpose"
"Had purchased this one in a discounted rate but having used it for 3 months, it feels like even discounted price was too much for this product. battery lasts hardly like 3 hrs. It works okayish from 100 to 50. After that, annoying battery low pop ups every minute. That's the worst thing you'd want as a music lover. And then it gets to 0 from 50 in around 10-15 mins.Pros:Bluetooth connectivity is okay.Sound quality is nice.Cons:Battery life is very low.Annoying battery low pop ups.Build up quality not up to the mark.There are much better products available in the same range, with much better battery life."
Product got in good condition all functions working properly only many times while calling i not able to hear voice of other person from bluetooth earphone than i have to answer the call via phone speaker so unless product also not recommended for online fps gaming their is huge and noticeable sounds delay many youtubers posted paid promotion video and not giving honest review i use this one only to hear song and while in gym and using boat rockerz 518 for gaming that also with wire working perfectly in wireless bluetooth earphone not recommended for gaming
Honest review after use of 3 days.1. Sound quality good.2. Battery life ok.3. Simple and good design.4.google voice assistant works well5. Usb type B charging instead of type C. This makes us to carry seperate charger.6. Don't read reviews buy it. Worth for 799Rs.8. As per money 100% good as compared to other products.
"Build: Looks sturdy but the feel is not that good. However, given the price and purpose, hopefully, it might survive careless use from my Son for at least a year.Sound: Good for online classes or podcasts, not at all for music and movies.I have been using other bluetooth headsets with TV and had no issue but this one is not at all usable for that purpose, sound keeps breaking like I am away from range but that's not the case."
"It shows of having a battery life upto 8 hours but it doesn't giving even 5 hours of continuous use.Its bluetooth connectivity is also poor. It's connection get blocked by a single wall. That means you can't use it in your home but if you use it in open place,you will get a range of 10 m.Its mic sound get distortion at the other end when you are on a call.It got a very bad phrases which interupt your music which I heard most people are complaining.It got some bad software sync with your phone. Like you charged it, you are using it and it doesn't show a battery drop after use and you think that it giving a great battery life but its not. That level drop drastically like from 100 to 50 directly and then you think that its a defected piece but its not. So this is also a issue.And at last, when you are on call it cut little sound from the other side like blocking signals. Its the earphone issue."
"First they sent me a defective peace, they replaced it within 2 days.It was working fine till now. Not more than a month ago I bought it. And now, it's increasing volume on it's own, changing tracks on it's own.It's happening since two days, when I went for jogging and it got wet with my sweat. It's sweat resistance ipx5. That's what it delivers in real. First I thought it will be fine after sweat drains. But two days and same problem..Very disappointed in the product..."
i have been using 1+ from past 1 year; with same price i tried BOAT... it was very disappointing on the quality of product.1.  Phone magnet is very week; it comes up even for slight touch (which is not the case with 1+2.  Doesn't move to Speaker mode when you put it back to magnet3.  Need to On after connecting to Bluetooth  which was not the case in 1+4. Sound quality is really bad compare to 1+
I bought a Boat Rokerz 245. which was delivered on the next morning. Nicely packed. Great sound but failed to connect to my Amazon fire stick. Then I complained about this issue and asked for a replacement considering the device might have incompatibility. Today morning I have received a new parcel as replacement. But this time the box is tampered and little crushed. This is a different model as per the box. This is Rokerz 245 V2. And sadly again this is also not connecting to my firestick. Do not know what to do. This purchase was with only replacement facility and not Refund. I missed to notice that at the time of purchase.
"The item is okay with terms of usage - connection, a neckband that ensures the two ear pieces are connected, however I have a major issue with volume. Even with the minimum volume of the audio/video app and also the earphone, it’s quite loud in the ear. It kind of blasts in the ear"
"I bought it only for music and gaming (battleground). And it satisfy in these two. I had a fear of delay in sound because of bluetooth in gaming, but it was so decent that I didn't even realise that I'm using a bluetooth headset. There is veryyy minor delay which you won't even notice in your daily gaming. Unless you wanna be professional go with better headphones*The only down fall of this headphone is, having problem in calls... Sometimes other person won't be able to hear you properly and its happening with all the sets of this model.Had no mice issue in gaming though.If you have calls in your priority then go with something else. For music and gaming you can definitely go with this budget friendly headphone."
"As long as you're close to the source it works well. But the minute you step away form the phone or the wifi it compromises the sound and especially the call quality.battery life is not impressive at all, but then dont expect the world at this price.Otherwise it is basic, competent and user friendly."
"Ive been using it since dec 21, the sound quality is great. However, the battery life sucks, really. I don't use the earphones so often, but when the battery reaches to 50%, the battery drains out quickly to 20% within listening to max 3 songs, then just dies"
"Sound quality- only bass, no treble and mid.Noise cancellation- great.Bluetooth connectivity has some issues with my laptop but works good with my mobile.Video lagging is spotted.It discharges sometimes without giving low battery indicator which is annoying.When from volume 1 we press 0 because sometimes even volume level 1 feels too loud, it says loudly that the volume has been brought down so loudly that it hurts the ear.Overall loved the product."
Formerly I purchased JBL head phone and replaced because of its poor quality. The replaced item is also in the same quality. At last the seller refund for the item.The second purchase was Boat. This one has a nice look. Connecting very fast. Sound quality and noice cancellation is very good.Recommending
"Charging port is not 'C' type.Once side of the eyer volume is little low.Battery backup is not good.Bluetooth range is horrible, less than 5 feet, audio & mic is breaking.Every time u switch on it, Irritating voice will welcome you."
"Getting this product in just Rs. 809/- was an amazing Amazon offer. In lower price range Boat is launching best products nowadays. Don't make mistake to compare this with higher range products (i.e. JBL/Sony/Bose etc.). However, undoubtedly this is the best product under 1K BT headphone's segment."
"After my personal experience for blutooth earphones I will never ever recommend to go for boat products because my earphones are not working only after 5 months even when the warranty period is for 1 year .On top of that after sale service is zero ,no customer care assistance will be provided ,on visiting website u won't be able to register ur online complaint due to unknown perpetual error of the website.I have tried for 2 months and still unable to register the same.Then I tried to call all the services centres of Delhi and noida ,and finally response received from only one service center only after regress efforts which was not at all satisfactory .So please don't ever go for boat products ."
Review after 1 month of useSound quality is good 👍Like every boat earphoneBluetooth connectivity is superbNoise cancellation is at it's bestThe only problem is it's battery draining fastAfter 30%So keep thatbin mind and recharge
The earphone is cool for jogging running. It wont come out of your ears while you are doing physical activities. Good audio quality.Cons:-1)If two devices are connected at once you might face audio delay or get audio first while watching video so make sure your earphone is connected with only 1 device at a time.2) The mic quality is not that good I wont say it will be that good as compared to higher budget earphones. If you want a good quality mic just raise your budget you won't get this much quality in just ₹699
"Be honest....I'm a boat fan. Believe me this was my 8th product of boat as I ordered, but now this time I got very bad experience....What to say about noise cancellation... Whenever shake my head after wearing it it produces very creepy sounds.Battery backup was very bad.I put it on charge from minimum 12hrs but beleive it couldn't get full charge.. (bhai aisa kon si battery lagaye ho liye hi jaa rha liye hi jaa rha)No bassMic was of very bad quality.And the most interesting thing.... The problems starts from 8th days after purchasing and the replacement day was onliy 7 days...😂😂😂😂 Nice boat good job.... Got cheated"
"These earphones has very good bass and if you tweak the Equalizer in your phone, you can have a very good experience. The mids and highs don't get muddled but I did have some connectivity problems with one of my phone. But a good purchase and recommended."
"The sound is descent but the bluetooth connectivity us just awful. Got Connected easily to any device but connectivity is not parallel, audio gets break continuously and kills all the joy of music."
NOT SATIFIED.BAD PRODUCT.NOT AT ALL GOOD FOR CALLS. THE PERSON ON THE OTHER END WON'T BE ABLE TO HEAR ANYTHING. EVEN IF WE HOLD THE MIC OF THE HEADPHONE NEAR TO THE MOUTH THERE IS NO VOICE CLARITY.I WON'T RECOMMEND THIS FOR ANYONE.
"I brought it as gift to my sister for rakhi, it got delivered 3 days before rakhi we didn't open it till the next day of rakhi the seals on it looked as someone opened it before and when we tested it left bud is not working, that's because its a product returned by someone and these people are sending these products to other buyers, these feels like cheating 😡"
This is such a poor iteration of the earlier version.Hands Free headset has all the controls on the dominant hand side. The power buttons and volume up/down do not have any difference in touch. The previous version was easier to use with the controls on left side.Purpose of these kind of headsets is to free up hands not “you better have your hands free” to use this.
A useless item is purchased due my bad liuck. I purchased through you on 10.2.22 and gone defective on 22.02.22. the last dateod return  was on 19.02.22 so you closed to he window for return  No i. Helplesd.  C AN YOU HELP TO GET IT REPL AS REPLACED
"It's a great product for it's price for sure! But you are not going to get the noise cancellation that is mentioned up there in the details section. Putting it aside. It's a good earphone it's got magnets to stick on,not the best bass or sound quality though....They give you 2 pairs of extra silicon tips one small and one medium.The actual earpiece has got the large.Over all a good product. It is truely value for money . It also got voice assistent that is very essential now a days . I recommend this product. Of course if you are looking for a earphones with complete noice cancellation then this is not a good choice . Overall the product is satisfactory..."
It's not properly working. Not even completed a month from the date which I purchased it's not working.I want to exchanges this one coz I got it 1 year warranty of this product and also there is no option for replacement  so it is request to u that please send someone to take it and get it new one at my doorsteps ..
"Its not teal green it's aqua blue in color, also I feel the bass quality could be better ;-; but I am satisfied with the overall gadget Boat never disappoints hehe, worth spending money, the battery backup is amazingly awesome, I've been playing it continuously for 6 -7 hours now and still 70% battery is available, this is what I loved the most about it, thank you Boat for such a lovely gadget and ofcourse Amazon for availing it at reasonable price."
"I don't know what kind of retarted reviews are being posted about this product but I kid you not this thing has enough bass; unless you want your ears to explode by wanting more of it.. The sound is quite filling, the mids and highs decent enough for any particular song."
Brand Boat is well know for its headphones and earphones quality and durability... But I replaced 2 times assuming there might issue in one of the item but all 3 of them were not good... There is connectivity issue and some disturbing sound while talking on the call
This is The Worst product I have purchased in the last 1 yearAbsolutely disgustingBattery Life is PATHETICDo Not Pay more than 50 rs for this piece of trashI will NOT recommend anyone to buy BOATDO NOT BUY BOAT products
"The earphones are good but if your ears are small as mine, the size of ear buds( the hard plastic part at the back, not the rubber ring) may create problem as it is too big and it is difficult to fit in small ears like me and the ears start paining within some time due to the big hard part at the back of the ear piece."
Within a month one ear bud gone faulty.If you complain to boAt they will ipck your from your address keep your headphones for 20+ days in the name of warranty and fault checking and later you will receive the same faulty headphone
"I was trusting boat from a long time. But when I purchased this I understood the real condition of boat. It's 3rd quality product. It got disconnected after every 5 minutes of use. Bass and Sound quality is pathetic. There's no noise cancellation. Always go for the products of OnePlus, JBL, Mi, realme etc"
I bought it on 22of September and it stopped working on 29 th I contacted to boat they told me n number of steps I followed that for the return process and then I wen to service centerThe product was out of stock and it happened multiple time .Finally the service personnel told to contact the company againWort service on any product I ever received.Just the wast of time and mony.And it not only hapoernd with me when I went to service center there were many people with the same problem.
"Mic not working properly, mic needs to be hold it near mouth, i have used may other brands but never faced such problem. From the day one i got this problem but was assuming it could be network issue, now its been one month issues is same so have raised complaint, waiting for headst to get replaced,  further will update on boAt service part.."
Must buy......Re ordered one more piece n the colour is terrific n received the next day....very happy with the product at reasonable price got such wonderful product......Thank you Amazon for bringing such good products to ur customers.....Al the best
"This product doesn't fulfill the standards of the brand ""boAT"".1. It is an below average product by boAT.2. Bluetooth Connectivity is very poor. It gets disconnected even when going to adjacent rooms.3. Battery Performance is okay.4. Surface finish is not so attractive.5. Highly disappointed."
This is actually not a good product...I'm using this headphone for past 5months & I'm really very very disappointed with this headphone... Actually I bought this product on November 2020 at the beginning time this was really good but later it shows its original face.. Yeah within 2months at the mid of January the right earphone was failure & it doest work for the last 2months (February & March) I have been using this headphone with only one side working for this last 2months... I request to amazon management pls kindly look my review & solve my problem ASAP.
Good one for basic use...Bass not upto the mark.But once it reach 70% battery goes down very fast.Battery charging also good.I brought at Rs 650 ... performance wise price and features is good
I fell prey on the brand and they didn't do any justice on sound quality. The basic requirement is good sound effect with Bass. Unfortunately this headset is utter waste for sound quality expectations. Just does the Job and for the brand they have priced it near 1K any headset around Rs.250(wired) surpasses the sound quality of this headset.
"Please dont buy it...1)Only after a month's usage left ear  plug is not working..2) Battery too much time to charge,3) battery doesn't last for more than 4-5hours , if continuously used.4) takes 8-10 seconds to get connected to your phone.Only thing is, it looks good. I have a local bluetooth neckband of Rs 500  tht works better than this. I am literally regreting aftr wasting my money on this."
कत्तई हग दिया boat वालों ने ये earphone सस्ते में मिल रहा था और boat का था इसलिये खरीद लिया लेकिन क्या पता था कि company कोई भी हो सस्ता सामान सस्ता ही होता है ये हद से ज्यादा मिल रहा था। एकदम घटिया और हल्की साउंड क्वालिटी है इसकी। मेरा 400 रुपये वाला earphone इससे कही ज्यादा अच्छी है। Refund भी नही ले सकता अब।
Very third class productI have purchased it in July 2021 after 2 month the one earphone is not workingNow I am trying to reach it's service center but I didn't get this also tried to help from Google to found service center but not get any service center in my neraby location The Service center is located 25 kilometres far away from my living locationSo I have recommended to all don't waste money for this product or any BOAt products
"Recently I purchased this product, ,protect was well packed , arrived on time, protect arrived without any external damage,  usage: sound clearly is very good, mic also working properly, Bluetooth connectivity  here n there reconnecting ,other than that protect is very good, so I  highly recommend ."
"Build quality sahi hai connection range kam hai baki sab mast hai charging time kafi jyada hai kitna bolte h uske dubble time me charge hota h or iski connecting problem bhut jyada hai meri jhat ho gai or bc sirf volume up down , dubble click krke call kr skte h or kuch nhi bc bich bich me disconnect ho jata h apne aap fir connect hone me 10 min lgata h sale ko 4 bar on off kro ek bar replace kra chuke tabbi yahi bakchodi h bs build quality bhut acchi h is liye mai boat leta hu pr bc itni gandi conetivity"
"The headset is light weight, battery is OK. It pairs with only one device. sound quality is good. Controls also works fine. Mostly loved feature is light weight. Product comes with 50% charge. Charger cable provided along with the order is too small."
Boot Rokkerआर 245 v2 क्वालिटी अच्छी नहीं है और स्पीकर में जो चुंबक लगी होती है जो इसको करो को जोड़ती है स्पीकर को जोड़ती है वह भी नहीं है जो हर आप दुकान पर देखते हो बूट का ब्लूटूथ ना उसमें और ऑनलाइन में धरती आसमान का फर्क है भाइयों आपको सलाह दूंगा कि आप ऑनलाइन ना मंगवाए क्योंकि अमेजॉन पर मंगवा कर रिफंड होने में भी दिक्कत होती है रिप्लेसमेंट करते हैं केवल और इसमें चार्जिंग डाटा केबल भी नहीं है प्लीज आप किसी दुकान से खरीदोगे तो  आप देख कर ले लोंगे
"I've always been a fan of Boat, and this Rockerz series never fail to amaze me.I have more than 4 Rockerz in my family and all of them are happy with the quality and battery life."
Dont buy this product.... Its not brand only it will work  for 1 month after getting issues... If u charge 100%also within 2 min it vl get reduce 15%And also it will not connecting to laptop perfectly.

" After getting Bluetooth worked good for only once...exactly once later I'm having issues with it...can't turn on ,can't pair easily even though it's fully charged but it isn't turning on just this is my fourth day using it and I hate this pieceSecond time when I kept for replacement I haven't received Bluetooth now😡it's irritating me😤"
There is little bit of distrotion in noise sometimes maybe due to bluetooth . Then it goes back to normal once I connecy thrm again. Bt this sjouldn't happen. Bass is ok. Fine at this price. Charging is required often. Get discharged very fast in about 2-3 hour time I dont know how. On sitr it was written it had long charged up time. But i was disappointed when I had to charge it so often.
I gifted it to  24 years young gu and he is using it  and he is very happy with its performance and battery backup upto week days with daily use of 2 hours calling and 2 hours of hearing of songs through Bluetooth
"Previously I have used 255 pro plus neckband so comparatively this looks cheaper, also sound quality is just average, bass is as good as missing, wires are quite delicate and not sturdy, volume control is not very sensitive sometimes need to press with extra force to raise or lower the volume"
"The Bluetooth device is working properly. No problem with the sound quality. But some problems occur frequently like audio plays ahead of the video and sometimes doesn't get connected properly. But the problems can be solved by restarting the earphone and Bluetooth of your device. Overall, it is the best product in the price range as per me. Can recommend others to buy the product. Battery life is also optimum. Till the... Adios Amigos..."
"It is an good product,sound quality is quite good and if you are a bass lover it is definitely for you!12 mm drivers produce really awesome bass,bluetooth connection is also good with a decent battery life,under 1000(I got for 799 only) it is one of the best,but it's build quality is not that good,especially the wires of earpieces are too cheap,otherwise it is a value for money👍"
"So bad we dont have negative rating for boat products. I really believe in life you get what you pay. However with boat, its you always get the worst product for whatever you pay."
"The product that I got is not of very good quality, looks like it's made up of very cheap material. While on calls most poeople complaint about my voice not being clear, so clearly the mic is not of good quality. Wanted to return it on the 2nd day itself but the box was already thrown and hence could not replace it."
"Product is good but received defective product. Distorted sound from right side bud.Battery backup 6/10Bass 6/10, with equalizing x player 3D 10/10Sound quality 8/10 with this price rangeMic 6/10  while send voice message environmental sounds disturbingWith X player 3D this will be amazing product"

 I was open the product and got already open packet box the main surprising for me that one item is damage and produt quality was third class no one purchase this item for  if they get free 500 rs but koi bhi dekh kr bolega nahi 1400 ka product he woh... I ordered I thought boat provide customers good quality but my experience is that I never again buy anything frm amaxon or boat

" Like really ? When I got the package it already had opened marks and when I opened it ,there was no earphones or anything, just some ppers and the charger I have requested for a replacement but it's not being accepted either"
Worst after sale customer support. My bluetooth device was not working and I send it back to Boat for replacement. Now it's been more than a month no update on my device. Customer care neither responding on call nor on email. Highly disappointed.
"I have this product 10 days ago worked fine base and sound was good for 7 days later on on right ear side there is a disturbance in voice and music on high volume mostly probably speaker issue and also it is disconnecting for every 10 min if the battery is below 60% on Bluetooth. So, i claimed the warrenty they have respnded well and they have picked up the product and waiting for the replacement"
Those who are saying bass is not good they probably using the wired 100 rupees earphones which has it's bass at the pick level.Value for moneyBass is good enough... You can't expect more at this priceBass is similar to Realme buds(wired)Vocals are goodCall quality is averageBattery life is awesomeYou can increase the volume additionally except the phone volume by clicking the + button... At maximum volume the bass is good enough...Must buy...
"Sound-wise it's decent, I've had instances of it automatically turning off, even without draining the battery. Battery life indicator on phone is inaccurate and useless. My biggest issue with this product is that its mic is pathetic. It is as if it amplifies all the surrounding noise except for your own! I've not been able to use it while placing a call without shouting into the mic, that's an unpleasant experience."
As committed the battery life 8 Hrs. instead it get drained in 4 hrs. of continues use only...it is not sufficient for long travel or full day office work...you always need to carry charger. also the sound quality is as like wired headphones...not like the other Boat quality products.
Bass is good. Noise cancellation is good when compared to price.It is very light you can't even know that you are wearing a neck band
Quality of headphones is not at all good....while speaking on call listener not able to hear voice....sound quality and battery is worst.....don't purchase it....not expected from boat brand.
"The sound quality is good, noise cancellation is also good, battery backup is also good but the quality of the bass is average. Bass is high but if you prefer bass quality than you will find it average. But considering the product price which fluctuate between 849-1299 it is a great deal."
"Sound quality is very good and the headphones remains connected well enough it good distance, things I felt as disadvantage is the beginning sound level is itself very high, once connected to a device reconnecting and connecting to the same device again after some time it fails only when we power off on the headphones it gets connected successFully"
"Very laggy. Once you connect to this earphone, it takes 5 seconds after clicking on video play before video actually starts playing. Without this earphones it starts instantly.The mic stops working mid call and have to reconnect again. Very frustrating. I stopped using this for meetings due to this issue.Boat rockers 255 and 261 doesn't have this problem."
"Very good sound, seemed very good product. Really disappointed that it just last 7 days. Used it 4 times, for half an hour on every use. While using them yesterday, volume kept going to minimum levels, every 10 seconds next song will be played and the device turned off and dint start again. Tried charging but no life left in them. P.s. it wasn’t raining at all. Better to look for other earphones."
Nice extra ordinary Bess and trabble love you boat coumpany and Amazon coumpany love 😍😍😍😍😍😍😘😘😘😍😍😘🥰🥰😘😍😘😘🥰😍😍😘😘🥰😍😍🥰🥰🥰😍😍😘🥰😘😍😍🥰😘😍😘🥰🥰😍😍😘😘😍😘😘🥰😍😍😍
"It is just an average product. While budget wise it serves as a great option, if you have enough money for some other headphones then seriously opt for something else."
"Everything is perfect, sound is just awesome, however packing was not up to the mark, go for it ."
"I have ordered boat Rockers Bluetooth earphone but the mic is not working,its battery is also getting low in just 2-3 hoursI drop a mail to their customer service but the no of their customer service centre is not valid .i drop a mail but it's been a month,I didn't get any Reply.Waste of money,I will never buy boat products"
"THE MATERIAL IS REALLY LIGHT AND FLEXIBLE. THE EARBUD IS THE FAVOURITE PART, ITS STRUCTURE IS REALLY NICE. OTHER PRODUCTS OF BOAT WEAR OFF EASILY. THE COLOUR IS ALSO PRETTY. MAGNETISM WORKS FINE. THE VOICE LEVEL IS ALSO PROPER. BATTERY BACKUP IS AS MENTIONED AND APPROPRIATE.OVERALL, ITS A SATISFACTORY PRODUCT IF YOU ARE LOOKING FORWARD A LIGHT MATERIAL EARPHONE.BUT THE BUTTONS ARE ON THE RIGHT SIDE SO IT BECOMES HARD TO ANSWER A CALL WHILE DRIVING."

 The Box was in bad condition👎 wanted to gift it to someone! Worst ever experience. The box was already opened before as the seal was open..The internals seem to be opened as well. Better buy from somewhere else.
"the connection takes something like 10 seconds which is 5-50X higher compared to other products( even boat 255). Audio/Call quality is poor; instead of these, just snag the cheapest pair of Bluetooth buds around, I don't think they would be much worse than these."
Very poor bass
Bought in Dec 2012 ..used daily one hour..now doesn't hold charge and drains off within 20mins. bad quality or its a fake. #BoAt can replace it please
I am so happy to use Boat Rockerz 245 V2 Bluetooth headset. This portable headset is my travel mate. The noise cancellation feature is really helpful.
"""body quality not good.next/prev. button not working, 🔋 life low, wire very thick comparison to other,sound quality excellent, bass performance good, if i press next button music stop. Thats why i wass irritated. If you wanna good quality,battary sound,bass etc. You try to oneplus....I think boat product 1000 price not working proper..."
"Turning on takes a lot of time, battery backup is not really great, maximum for 5 hours if it's continuously connected with the phone or laptop. Their is nothing like 10 mtr connectivity."
"Don't buy this product the battery is not good. This product as battery issues. With in 2 months I am facing battery issues. The charge timing is also takes long the battery stands just for 45 min, even after a charge of one hour. One of the worst headphone in boat. Its is not the value for money. Pls do not boy this product and do not west the money. The sound quality is also not satisfied."
"The sound quality is excellent. The battery backup is average. For prolonged conversations it won't last for multiple hours. Moreover, it can be connected to multiple devices at the same time, so I found this feature useful. In addition, it can be changed quickly.One negative point the charging cable which came along with it, is small."
I advise to not buy this product. Very bad product at all. Sound quality is ok but Even after 50% of battery it says oops battery low and turn off in 2 min.1 hour charging and it stay just 2 hoursI had replaced first by thinking that i got a damaged product but it seems by default damaged one.First product what i really fell money waste from amazon.
"It's good at price 899/-But it's have some connection issues in long distance from your phone.Sound is awesome infact I use SONY WH-200, It's give edge in some songs not for allU cannot expect more in this price range.."
"This is a good product, and what company claims is 8hrs battery life but after using it for 1-2 months the battery life is very poor.Even when the earphones are switched off the battery will get drain off. Not happy with the battery life of this product.Better to buy wired earphones."
Bkwas h yeh.. bilkul mt khridna isko.. call krte tym mic ko bilkul hoto se chipkana pdta h tb jkr dusre bnde ko awaj aati h.. wrna awaj nhi jaati.. sound quality b kuch khas nahi h iski. Agr sirf song sunne k liy lena h toh le skte ho agr call k liy lena h toh bilkul mt purchase krna. Kyuki return b ni hoga
"Go for it. You won't be disappointed. The sound quality is really good, and the noise cancellation is amazing for this price point. One full charge lasts for about a couple days (if you don't use it too much/switch it off between uses), and the battery didn't drain off unnecessarily. Definitely a pair of earphones worth investing in."
"True to its brand name, the sound and bass quality are amazing. Noise cancellation is fine. Definitely a good product the fits snugly in the ear."
"Looking very bad and the most important thing I can't even return it ,, there is not any return policy only replacement available . Very bad experience from Amazon"
"Base is good. But sound clearity is not that much. This will give you good base, although base lovers will enjoy. Sound is loud. But you will not get that overall clearity.It's very lightweight & it will not give you the feeling that you are wearing a neckband.Overall a Good product. Good for base lovers."
"It stopped working automatically after 2months apx. Whereas other brands works fine who bought before me. I've more Headphones from BOAT, and they all are same stopped working after few months. I suggest you to buy anything on AMAZON their customer service agent just ask for More time everyday if you need any REFUND."
"Bass is ok,but very high volume as compared to my infinity glide 100,it is irritating at sometimes.But the sound quality of infinity glide 100 is just wow.If you are looking for a high volume bluetooth headphone go for it,or for  best sound quality headphone go for infinity glide 100.Connnectivity perfect ,no issues."
The built quality is good and battery is 6 hour non stop power.As per comfort my ear get pain after half an hour and pain increases so it is not good as my previous Bluetooth huawei am61 more comfort more power 11hour battery.Some time sound is gone while connect with laptop.
"I had to get the product replaced cause there was a cracking sound wherever I listened to it. After I got it replaced, initially it worked fine and then later on it started doing the same. However by the time the cracking sound started, I couldn't get it replaced, since the time had passed. Now I'm stuff with earphone which give a cracking sound all the time."
Look wise it’s premium but if you talk about sound quality and it's build quality it is like non branded product. there is so many issues to know like the control button off this product is so hard to and when you are on call and you try volume up and down then  the and tik tik sound can hear by the other person too on call.Wouldn’t recommend.1/5
I like this head phone.....👌👌I am using it while my work out.....but only Disappointing part is buds size are Big.... otherwise it's really nice product.....I would recommended to go for it guy's....😊 if you are budget is less than ₹1000.....👍👍👍
"After using 3 weaks,,, I have face worest experience because quality is very bad,, sound base charging also very bad... Now it's not working.,.. I lost my money.. please how to contact customer care and how to exchange or return product,."
You too don't be disappointed after buying this product. Reasons are1. poor sound quality2. Glitches at high volume for bass songs.U will find these issues after few days.I experiencing these issues for the second time. For the first time I made return order after facing above mentioned issues. But this time same issue continued.
"Cons:1. Headset charging display is not accurate.2. If you use regularly, you will face outer ear pain. Due to the bad structure.3. Charging life nearly 4hrs only.4. My headphone is not working after 10 days of usage & I'm not able to return this item(worst product)"
this product is given problem with Bluetooth connectivity. after six months of use I go to the service center to exchange the product now I have an issue with battery backup
"Not a good one... I was stunned to hear a thumping-like sounds delivered by the headphone... ""Power on"" and ""Power off"" notification sounds are really long and boring... Had a great expectation before unboxing, almost all went in vain"
"Earphones are best in its price range, . But lacks some features, like i want a ear support tip like other boat earphone bt its weird to get a small oval shaped tip, which is useless for me. Another one is it doesn't have vibration. Though this are boat products bt, looks a kind of cheap. It seems to be successor of 235 v2, bt its not."
"Runs out of juice really fast (5 hours or less). Has pairing problems really quickly. Sound quality was good until the pairing issues, now there are complaints that I cannot be heard properly. Had picked this up for work related use with laptop, regret buying this model."
"Received today, Sound quality is good. Build quality is descent.Time will tell how it standstill."
Got the color which I wanted. Best one. As per price it's very much worthy.. Within this range u get the best quality and warranty. Must buy. Satisfied with the sound quality and the look is really attractive.
Decent product at the price range.could have done better on noise cancellation.sound quality is good.connectivity range is average.plastic material used is good for rough users.playback time is around 6-7 hours on medium volume once full charged.
Sound quality-5/5Base- 4/5Battery- 4/5 (upto 7-8hour continuous playback time)Weight- 5/5(light weight)Calling voice- 5/5 (clear audio at both receiver and sender end)Charging time- 3/5 (about 1.5 hour)Gaming - 5/5Overall: 5/5 this is a really good product if u are looking for something under 1000.
"iam a big fan of boat brand but i purchased this product ,i received bad quality product,connectivity issues are getting repeatedly, and wifi issues at  getting."
I didnt like as it is very much discomfort to ear. Doesnt fit at all. I gv 0 star.
Within a month I was replace this products.. Most 3rd class product made by boat... I was visit boat customer support page n exchange the product. Be careful before buying this .. Time n money both wasted😔
"I've purchased boat rockets 245 V2 and it's mic was not worked so I've requested for replacement,  for replacement product also have same issue so I've requested for refund.Finally at the end its mic is not good enough to receive call or outgoing call.Don't buy It"
Replaced it once still the same mic output very low need to hold it close to mouth whill talking.I purchased it to use it while riding bike but it hurts the ears badly when wore in the helmet.Bad range aswell.Overall no value for money.
ordered boat 245v2.item dint work and not getting charged. So we asked for replacement and got the same product. But replacement one is also not getting charged. we are returning the replacement one. Disappointed when we gave as a gift to cousin. Kindly consider the issue. Please do Check and dispatch in future.
"4 दिन ही चलाएं और इसकी साउंड क्वालिटी बिल्कुल खराब हो गई,,कुछ भी सुनाई नहीं देता है,, रिटर्न करने के लिए भी कॉल लगाया लेकिन  1 महीने हो गए अभी तक कोई नहीं आया"
I've used 1 month &  it was good especially the bass. But from yesterday i.e. on 8/9/21 I couldn't able to hear Audio. I've tried so many times to solve the problem through re-store but couldn't..Now I dnt have any options also to Return/Replace. I'm very Disappointed with this Product...if I could than i'll give Less than 1/4 of 1 Star

 totally disappointed from this purchase of earphone .it has started buffering after using it for 4hrs. first time amazon has disappointed me for this purchase as I m the regular customer of AMAZON. I hv wasted 700 rs
Bought it as it's from boAt . But close during conversation is not clear to other end. Poor range of bluetooth (2-3meeter). There is no provision of return only replacement is there. Theybreplaced product but after 15 days it got defective and not working at all. Did not expect this from a company like boat
Product is so good. Quality of bass is sooo good. If you want a quality earphone under budget than don't hesitate to buy this.Go for it.Just buy.THANK YOU AMAZON. THANK YOU BOAT.😊😊😊
"Call quality is very badAlso the battery is not lasting for 30 hrs as mentioned in the description, it's nearly 10-12 hrs"
"Excellent sound quality in both call and music.Very battery life, bass and decent noise cancellation.Exceptional value for money"
there is a connection problem with this bluetooth earphones when we connect it to our phone it disturbs the wifi connection as i am not able to use high speed wifi in my phone .and after  i disconnect the earphones the wifi speed is back to normal. i have tried in many phones connecting this earphones n checking speed of internet..
1.Battery backup is ok it's not come 8 hours backup just it come 3 to 4 hours also if the battery percentage goose beyond 50% the earphone will die within 15 minutes.2.Mic quality is very poor if I attend the call after 15 second seconds only the receiver will hear my voice not one time two time... Every time it's happening.
The product worked for only 2 weeks till replacement was allowed. Now only charging do not connect with output music devices. Power button works only during charging.
It's not working for teams call/ skype call through laptop as caller can't hear us but we can hear them. Its working well with mobiles only. So office oe school purpose users please go for higher version and check everything prior to return date. So you can replace or return it.
After using 1 week it's stop working now m not able to connect with this head set  it's the worst product I ever seen I thought its doublicate product.
"Sound is not that great, bass is cannot be heard. After a month you will struggle to pair the headphones with your phone, needs a hard reset.Better options available than this one"
"This product is very good like sound, bass and design is also good but his battery is very loose.It's means, battery backup is didn't longer timeand It takes too much time to charge.So any electronic items overall depending on battery backup...like as mobile, laptop and Bluetooth connection earphones ets."
"Overall headphone is very good but the only problem i am facing is Bluetooth Latency while Calling. Almost 5 to 10 sec late voice. I replaced this product, i thought product i received was a faulty product. But new replaced product also have same issue."
Sound quality is good... As same as Noice tune charge and somewhere equivalent to rockerz 225Build quality is delicate... Wire is not so thin... It's medium... Earphones somewhere looks delicate (might break in rough usage)There is lag in sound in pubg... But bluetooth connectivity is smoothIf u are a not so much music lover than u should try boat rockerz 245 v2.
i bought this handsfree last month jan22 and now there is problem. i inserted chargging cable but device is not charging.  very very bad quality . quality is under question. ordinary handsfree will work for 6 months but boat handsfree not able to complete 2 months . VERY VERY DISAPPEARED WITH BOAT
First thing after use of certain months I fell that out of 100% you can only use 60As soon you you get 40% it's over.Sound quality is decentValue for money I can't say because many other options are available near around same price point
"Worst product I have used, gives battery backup of less than one hour, while using , when battery get 70% , it get sweech off. Waist of money, offers ke naam pe chutiya baba rahe hai amozon wale"
"If battery was not a problem it is a better choice .because battery drains superfast between 50 to 10 and it withstand for about 5 to 6 hours other than that all are ok ipx 5 water resistant , magnetic earbuds etc .. good bass quality etc..... But battery was not sufficient you might often need to be charge the headphones"
"Good sounds quality,,better life is long , sound is good,good offer by amazon"
i bought it for 700 rupees and for that price it is a quite decent product. The only problem with the product is that the earbuds are on the heavier side so cant use them continuously for a longer period of time.
The product is defective as blue tooth is not functioning properly as lot of disturbance in using. Please replace it with a new one since the return date is expired by 11th of this month. Due to delay in using I could not found the problem. Do needful in the matter as the product is under one year warranty
Its a worst buy. I think I got old product but I got replacement and the second replacement was not at all connecting neither working and second replacement initiated refund. Thanks to amazon
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
 it's very bad experience with Amazon and with boat this device battery pack up is to low it's not getting more than 24 hours
"I got replacement of this Bluetooth headphone. First one is defective his one left side sound is not working.then I replaced it.His sound quality, noise cancellation and connectivity is good."
Awesome sound with bass ...  I got in 999 rs... Affordable price....  Use + button on your headphone for full volume then see the results... Every thing is extremely good
"After 2-3  months use , one side speaker off and charging time automatically increased, mic is not good, voice not going properly, noise cancellation is medium.This product is not for long time use.Battery life is not good."
The product is okay for the price range but while connecting and increasing or decreasing the volume it gives irritating instruction like “Minimum volume”
Sound quality: it has a decent sound. The treble is not ultra crisp but the bass is decent.Noise cancellation: not the best out in the market but what more do you want from a budget earphone?Battery life: pretty good. The charging time of 1.5 hours could have been better.
"Every thing is absolutely fine with this, but battery is not uptomark. From 100% to 70 % battery works smoothly, but then battery drops rapidly with warning starting at 40%."
"The battery life is so poor, it's irritating. Can't return, their is no option for it. Stuck with this piece of trash."
"Earphones are great, just you can't use it to speak to another person and everyone will report disturbance. .can't find a way to return.  Boat is just good with low cost wired devices. Honestly brand has lost its charm of low cost high quality product!!"
"Battery of this sucks guys, after 50% it just switch off within barely 15-20 mins; everything else is fine like sound quality, noise cancellation and yeah Bluetooth connectivity also get blocked by just a wall so i'd say it's a very poor quality product even for the price of 799, Go for MIVI instead"
A useful tool to speak over phone. But same can't be said about media playing. Battery lasts long enough for phone calls over 2 to 3 days
The product is just okay. No bass so if you want bass don't buy them.  The sound intensity is very High and terrible as well.
"I used this product it's very nice and it's noice cancellation,good sound productivity,and the blutooth connectivity also good I liked dis product thank you for your customisation and whatever they mentioned that all the things I got belong with the product."
There is some problem with the mic. The receiver doesn't hear me properly. Sometimes takes more than 5min to connect to the bluetooth. Writing this review after using it for two months.
Very good product and easy to handle. And sound quality is very good but noise cancellation is not so good and Bluetooth connectivity is also good but we can't change song through button. Although the product is very good and very good at this range. The charging cable quality is also very good but the number of extra bud is very less.
Though the sound quality is good will not recommend this product due to its battery backup. It is mentioned that battery will last for about 8 hrs but after 2 and half consecutive hrs of use battery is completely draining.
Received seal broken product. With poor sound quality and poor battery backup
I recommend it if anyone is in searching branded neckband in low price ITS BATTERY LIFE IS FANTASTIC IF U USE IT WITH LOW AUR MEDIUM VOLUME  EVEN AT HIGH VOLUME ALSO BATTERY LIFE IS GOOD IT IS BEST FOR ONLINE CLASSES AND IF ANYONE LOVE TO STUDY FROM YOUTUBE MORE THAN BOOKS ITS PERFECT
For the price this is the best branded with warranty.  Noise cancellation is definitely not good [I will not say poor] which needs to be addressed
"The headset was defective, On ordering replacement, the delivery guy phone number along with PIN was always unreachable. After then, the status became ""Exchange failed for verification"" without anyone visiting my home. Now left with a defective set."
Dont Buy it!  worst thing is that: If we are watching movie-> audio is not matching with video. It means the audio transfer speed not acceptable. I try with other earphone of same movie it was good. I always say true! ..... Jo hai so Hai.all other is good! but the above mentioned problem not acceptable.
This review is based on using this product for almost 1 month. The battery life is same as mentioned is products details. Sound quality is good.As I bought this product at offer price so it's value for money. If you want good quality wireless earphones at reasonable price then you can surely try is one.
"I purchased it on 11 December and it didn't go for even one month..it's out of order no mic , no voice working..it's worst experience.. I didn't expect such experience from Boat company..Worst product experience"
I loved the product so much and really happy using itThe price is very reasonable. I wont write a big review but am sure u gonna love this productIts really amazing
Bahot badhiya ..Paisa wasool ..Purchased in republic day sale in just Rs. 699/- ....Sound quality -- ExcellentNoise cancellation -- NiceBass -Execllent
BLUETOOTH IS NOT WORKING PROPERLY. DON'T BUY THIS BLUETOOTH DEVICE IS THE WORST PRODUCT OF THE BLUETOOTH DEVICES I've used.ब्लूटूथ ठीक से काम नहीं कर रहा है। इस ब्लूटूथ डिवाइस को ना खरीदें मेरे द्वारा उपयोग किए गए ब्लूटूथ डिवाइस में से सबसे खराब उत्पाद है।
We have to say this time..That amazon product boat bluetooth very pathetic made us down and waste of money...I wouldn't prefer that boat bluetooth to anyone.....1. Voice breaking2. Not proper music we can heard by this..3 noise cancellation not working...4. Incoming call problem...
Bluetooth connectivity is very bad and the sound quality deteriorates if the proximity is more than 2 meters. You need to keep your device really close and static if you don't want the Bluetooth connectivity to annoy you.Don't be fooled by what the company says. It doesn't really have 5.0 Bluetooth connectivity
Amazing song quality & balanced at every aspect. I bought it for 899 and it is value for money. Very very comfortable for the users who like chill songs & use for a long time. Bass is not that much strong. Battery backup is amazing.😍
"I got this at a very good deal.After use of 2-3 days.genuine reveiwSound quality is good, and noise cancellation is okay, battery backup is 5hrs max if used continuously. Connects quickly to a device.sometimes there is issue with mic ,other side they are unable to hear my voice."
Getting good sound and product quality is also good according to price range but more options are also available.
The earphones seem to be a decent one. But i have  started observing issue with it. The voice is not clear and during playing song it gets disconnected just like having a bad network connectivity. This started happening after my return date has lapsed. So cant return as well.
"Great quality, one day battery life, blue colour looks cool and fun. In all it's a great product, and offers more that the money we pay"
"After 6 days of use I am writing. This product is total value of money. Bass is excellent, battery backup 8-10 hours, noice cancellation is little bit an issue otherwise amazing product. You can go for it."
It is the worst product for connectivity issue during phone calls whatsapp calls you cannot listen other persons voice....even can't listen a single word .....it gets like muted call....waste of money...i want to return this product...i have used it fo a month...but now it is showing its originality.
"It had been less than 20 days the batteries are draining like hell.. for initial days it worked well but now the battery flies .. within 5 minutes the battery will go 10% from 50% .. and bad thing is , my return window got closed.."
This product is not up to mark. Always makes a hissing sound. Bass is good but battery backup is not more than 4-5 hours while using continuously. Some time shuts down suddenly and unable to pair.
Within only 2 months of usage stopped working. Not good product. Need to ask for replacement or service.
"Not so good for use while exercising , sitting back and watching movies yes it does the job quite nicely"
"Have to keep charging it now and then. Sound quality is satisfactory. Looks attractive but is very flimsy. As someone who has used bullets wireless, I'm not satisfied. But for the price, it's a pretty good deal."
It’s a great product in this price range.Does all the basic duties a Bluetooth earphones should do with low latency!
Earbuds are not comfortable. It's hurting. No noise cancellation. Sound is audible when the volume is raised to maximum level even in the silent atmosphere. Voice clarity is better while talking in phone calls.
Sound & Bass Qualy is Good and you can't expect more at this price. No connectivity issues. But Build quality is not upto the mark as previous products. Less Weight
ProsAll over good qualityBass quality goodConsBattery backup only 5-6 hoursSome time auto disconnectedDesign could be batterBattery level not showing perfectVibration missingSlow charging
When u hear song and video it's best but when u speak on call it's average as sound I not much loud when u speak
Bad connectivity and worst notice cancellation. I imagined it fit well but completely disappointed. Some times auto disconnect even mobile in my hand.
"Worst Mic in the device. You won't be able to make a call with this. The reciever will recieve very feable voice over the call.Sound quality is average, bass is okay. But if you wanna make call with this device, don't."
"Sound Quality is Good, but the noise cancellation is bad and bass is also not that strong, but good. Build Quality is Superb."
this was very poor quality product very sensitive on same price another brand good product available in market .
It is not good quality at all. It stopped working within few days after the return window.The headset has poor audio quality. The battery discharges within few days.  It does not worth a star at all.
"Easy to sync and use. Audio quality is good and Its Bluetooth connectivity is also good. It's connection get blocked by a single wall. That means you can't use it in your home but if you use it in open place, you will get a range of 10 m."
Absolutely Disappointed. Got used product in Sale. Sound quality on call is Worst. Getting Humming sound in background on call. Not useful for calling at all. Replaced once. Still issue is same. Got Refund. I personally recommend please don't purchase this product.
"Mic not working with Dell latitude 2021 model laptop.With Android, it is fine.Boat headset pairs with the same laptop very well."
"Cheap plastic , not same grade colours shown in pictures and take really long time to charge as said 1.5 hours just for 100-120 mah small battery like a my phone of 4000mah will get full charge... Sound is good enough for discount price but boat is OnePlus dnt have high hopes."
It automatically gets power off after a certain time if we are not listening a music so it saves power ...but on the other side power on/off button could not change the song I.e couldn't play next in the quening of playlist but it sometimes opens a Google Alexa or sometimes calls to the last on in the call history
"Battery life is not good as it can easily drop from 100% to 40% in a couple of hours. The drop from 40 to 10 happens on 10 minutes! With the annoying voice announcing "" battery low"" every 30 seconds. Cannot be used for office work."
"It's mic either doesn't work at all or catches my words with lag when on whatsapp video call, otherwise great."
"While the sound quality was very good, the mic stopped working within 3 months time. Product quality is not great for this price"
"The worst product I have seen in my life. They give me replacement of earphone. But same problem arrived with the replacement product. If you want listen 3 song in one single charge, then purchase it. Otherwise go with other company. Local earphone is good comparative boat rockerz 245 v2"
"a Great Ear Phones. good sound quality both bass and treble. but Mic volume is absoultely low. when using to calling, people on the other side complainted they could bearly hear anything."
"Not getting charge properly, even i am charging it for 3 hrs then also not turning ON very much dissatisfied"
Bought it on Sale gor Rs. 799. However the battery lasts fewer hours than the 255pro+For 1 - 2 hrs daily usage 245 or 255pro are better as they are cheaper. However 5 - 6 hrs usage per day requires 255pro+ battery.Also the sound quality ( inculding bass) is better on 255pro+
"Worst product ever from reputed boat company which I received, I thought old product was refurbished, but the replaced item which I got is also the same one. And not working efficiently. Gonna return the product. And need to file a complain against the product."
Sound quality is good but very poor noice cancellation I want a good handsfree for voice calling with noise cancellation and when I talking someone's on call they always says voice is very low. Not comfortable for calling. I don't suggest for calling purpose otherwise good in price...
Only the music sounds to be good. Please don't buy it. Low quality less weight you can't use it in traveling in a bike. Call quality not good. Battery package worst. And if battey low it contineously says battery low for every 10 seconds.
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
" I don't like this product. the sound quality of this product is very poor. And battery also. I want to return this product, so I can purchase the upgrade version of this product.ThanksRegardsNilamadhab Satpathy"
"- do not buy this if you love bass only! Zero bass literally, trouble will leash your ears totally. Zero bass overall its good if you love low volume. Not for music lover, overall, things are okay. 12NM drivers are worst thats why no other brands making headphones products on 12nm."
Good product and fast delivery
"Mic quality is not good else all ok,Mic quality is not good else all ok,Mic quality is not good else all ok,Mic quality is not good else all ok,Mic quality is not good else all ok,Mic quality is not good else all ok,Mic quality is not good else all ok,Mic quality is not good else all ok"
"The sound quality is very good as per the price,lows, mids, and highs everything is properly balanced ,the bass is also sufficient if you are not a heavy base lover,but the build quality is not good but what built quality can we expect at this price point."
"Overall product is upto the mark ,fast delivery, excellent voice , best quality  in this price range"
Colour and shape is good. But sound quality and noise cancellation is not good. Bass is working with the help of Music app only but not with the headset itself.
Ok product as per its price range. Sound quality is not very impressive but preety nice. As I bought it  for handsfree calling only so it solved my purpose very well.
"Just ordered this day before yesterday for my dad. Its light in weight but the sound quality is good. Bass is nice, also love the vocals quality throughput of this earphone. Recommended buy."
t's not properly working. Not even completed a 6months from the date which I purchased it's not working.I want to exchanges this one coz I got it 1 year warranty of this product and also there is no option for replacement so it is request to u that please send new one ..
Its  not original product…quality wise its ok ok….I didn’t even get the charging cable…really disappointed…didn’t expect this from Amazon.waste of money…im really very much disappointed
"Good sound quality, good noise cancellation, however, the battery is unpredictable. It will show 60% battery status and start giving warning in 30mins. Though the overall back up seems decent."
"looks good otherwise 0 bass, sound quality is below average, not worth for money and hearing experience is like a road side selling 50rs wired head set. spending money for the brand name otherwise useless totally disapointment and not even willing to give a single star also"
The sound quality during calls is the worst there is always disturbance in the background during callsAnd there is no refund policy so please think before buying

 Dislike this product because not work properly and Amazon are very clever they close the exchange window very quick so don't like the boat product not even the Amazon service......Press a long button of on but it's not work
Everything is good... but have a problem..that when ever its connected with my phone nd my phone is connected with wifi/hotspot..the internet starts to buffer..it gets me in lots of trouble..that time.. coz we all need wifi connection. But the product doesn't supports it..
I ordered this one Because I didn't had the budget for boat earphones 255.....but I received very cheap quality earphones so I returned it....after some time during the sale....boat 255 was at the same price and I get a chance to buy it....now I am very satisfied using it
"Been using is for a couple of months now. The sound quality is good enough, fit is also great, the only bothering factor to me is it's playback time. It is said that it has upto 8 hours of playback but it's about 6 hours or even less, let's just say it's OK for it's price"
While watching movie it automatically  switch off...after sale service is good.they pick the product Repair & delivery the product at ur address..wow amazing
As name boat sound is always amazing bass is good not much but playing music is really good Build quality is decent cheap not good plastic connectivity is 7-8 meter without wall and over rating if I give is 4/5 1 is not for build quality everything is amazing
Saying Oops battery low every twenty seconds when there's 40% battery left is an utter failure of design. Impossible to enjoy any music with this message ruining the experience. Do NOT buy.
"Connectivity issue, bluetooth gets disconnected many times while using on calls as well as listening music, low quality wire of earphone,  i had read previews this type of reviews then too purchased,  it was a wrong decision buying this item. Don't buy it."
I got the product.but it was an open box gave to me . Courier package it's ok. i'm using this headset have bluetooth connectivity issue. not proper working.. every time call connect no sound.only playing music its very well..not worth @ calling..
After using 3 months quality is good and Sound is clear...but Bluetooth connectivity is poor when i make  distance(one room to another room) between devices and earphone
"Simple design.but product quality is very good.BoAt knows the Value of money . Naturally product is best in the price range . If you want to use branded products , you can go for it .(According to me)...but I have bought it in 999 but now it is only 749😔 and the price is changing time to time less about 699"
"Would've given Overall product review 0. I've bought this product 5 months ago and despite it's 1 year warranty, only one earpiece is working. Very much not happy with product."
It's a very fraud of Boat Ever used by me.It's getting switch off even battery remain 50% charge.It's getting switch of in between listening music for 10 secs.
The product worked properly only for 4 months before it showed problems in pairing and connecting with phone. The biggest problem is to switch it on even though the charge is full. Not recommended at all.
Within a month one side went mute while speaking call sometimes the mic is not working properly so much disappointed from boat
Very poor connectivity. frequently gets disconnected while on call.Bad quality and absolutely bad user experience.
Its good but battery not up to the mark..Which matters lot... so max i can give 3 stars
"Very poor quality. It is useful to listen to music. But, if you talk, there is a lot disturbance and the person at the other end can't hear, however loud you try to speak."
"It gives good sound quality, music bass,noise cancellation feature, comfortable ear buds."
For the brand boat one enough to buy . And my experience using it almost seems to be expected one for the price range . Well sound effects and bass sounds . One I feel bad myself noise cancelling . It make background noise sometime . Otherwise the product to be great
Mic is not working properly. The other persons on the call are saying my voice is low regardless of how loud i am
It is not working properly sometime it connect or sometime and disconnect I don't know what is happening with this headphone but not working.I don't know how to get the service if anyone is there can help me for the service or change this device please help me
Design color is fine.Speaker volume is fine.One issue.....On the call other person is getting low voice.It can be difficult to hear to other if i am in market.
"Sound Quality is not upto mark it resembles the quality of local headset we use to buy from market in 150,200, Background noise is audible to the other person in call, doesn't connect automatically to Bluetooth Everytime I have to on and off via switch."
I purchased two pcs of wireless headphones of boAt on 21 September 2021. In just two months look at the condition of ends in pictures.Not worth to purchase at any cost. Even in salealso.
"Worst product.. lots of disturbence in call, bluetooth keep disconnect also it redial any random number from my call log...Waist of money i ordered in Jan and they delivered to me in Feb.Copy product don't buy it from Amazon..For original buy it directly from Boat website."
Jitna iske bare me likha h utna h nahinBettery makup to bahut hi kam hLikha h 8 hourS deta h  1 hours ka makupKoi Dost Amazon se nahin maganaKyoki Amazon kharab wala delivery deta hainBoat ka saman itna kharab hai ab hame pataa chalaa
Very much satisfied with audio quality of boAt Rockerz 245 v2 Bluetooth Wireless
Battery performance is not good. Draining to fast. Once its reachEd on 50% battery 5mnt me 10% ho jayegi. Agr bdw koi glti se lele to to replace krk phir refund policy hoti hai... don't buy..
"Performance is good, But durability is worst.Quality in performance doesn't means that the product is long lasting.You are lucky if you can use this product at least for two years.Overall Performance :- 3.8/5Durability :- 0.5/5"
Very poor quality stop functioning in less than 10 days . Even 30 rupees product worked at least 90days but it not even work for 9 days. Fraud fraud fraud. Very dissappointed dont expect from amazon not going to buy any even1 rupee product from amazon in future.
Please Don't Buy This Stupid Boat Earphone Its Design Is So Irritating Will Hurt Your Ear If You wear More than an hour....And Stupid Magnet quality Too.... Don't Waste Your Money I would Suggest You to Buy Ptron Tangent Beats Better Than This Thousands Times!!!
"The order got delivered today. I am in love with this bluetooth earphones. Built quality, sound, noise cancellation, bluetooth range 10/10😍😍😍👌👌👌.Go for it and yes those who are commenting negative they might have got defective piece."
Bass quality is aswome sound is super.they gue battery life 8hrs but i am using since 5 hours in 60%-70% volume still now it's 50%now.the sound 60%-70%is very heavy.who are bass lovers will enjoy with this product.12mm drives are good.thanks to Boat.Amazon's fast delivery is good.
Bass : its goodConnectivity: best inside home but it may nob be good outsideIts easy to use i like it and highly recommend it to u .Value for money: yes i do have a value of money i bought it in offer where it was of 799 its worthBattery backup: yes it is good
"I bought this product for its 12mm driver and it performs well with that. But the mic is worse than product's description. Also the battery backup is not 8hours, it gives at most 5 to 6 hours playback time. But overall it is a nice product for this price range."
"I'm very disappointed with this headsets, sound quality is very poor getting so much of disturbance and while on call also not at all getting clear voice"
My experience is good...Good for mobile phones....Works brilliantly on dolby Atmos....It enhances the quality of the product...Playback is aound 4-5 h in continuous use...Should be more .....Not working as good as in lappi...
"Easy to connect, Good quality while taking, hearing music,watching film etc..."
At first the connectivity of it a little bit unstable. After sometime it's rocovered but when I took a call through this then the main fault was exposed. In the other side of the phone the recipient of the call couldn't hear anything. I gonna return this item.
Best as far as the durability and the sound are concerned....but battery drains out much faster than expected...not advisable for chronic users...I'm happy with the sound effect and the matte finish...which makes gives it a subtle look!!
Audio assistant is irritating. Bus connected and disconnected bolo and other one word action items. Fokat ki tata bye pata NH kya kya bolta h ye bhai. Same awaj sun sun kar Pak jaoge.Aman bhaiya team se bolo sahi karaye.
Good product. Bass is beyond average. Much better than other options in this price range. Worth of money great.
"This headphone is good quality, but in the time of  incoming call not telling caller number, that is bad feature in syska LB300 this feature is available, but overall good."
Sevice is not good I bought of this but with 3 month  one of ear plug not working and I not attending callAnd I went in Karol baag to exchange this but there was so croud there are facing same problems and taking so long time to return more then 1 month
"for indoor use, this is fine. if you want for outdoor use, this is not worthy. Bluetooth connectivity also very worst. Better to go for higher models. sound quality is fine."
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
 The indicator does not work when charging.  It is not possible to know whether there is a charge.I don't know if it has a charge or if it works. No sound.It's been like this for a week. Can you help me?
Everyone would love it.At first i received a defective product but thanks to Amazon that they replaced it with a new one. Go for it!!
"Nice product value for money! The quality of it is really nice and clear , about battery it doesn't disappoints at all great battery backup for music lovers ! Noise cancellation mode works pretty well ! . For gaming i would say those who considering for gaming Purpose than please its not that ! ."
I got the item before the target date but it didn't work. I charge it but not on after that too. I requested for replacement but still waiting to get the item delivered. Already replacement target date it over and still I am waiting and getting frustration.
This Bluetooth is not as expected. I am hearing lot of background noise and the person speaking in my opposite is unable to hear anything. Return window closed within 5 days whereas in amazon its mentioned as 10 days. unable to find an option to replace it.
"Extremely poor quality, voice breaks so much on calls, battery back up so low. I bought boult neckband earlier. That was much much better. Now I can't even replace it with any other neckband. Hate this. I lost my 1000 bucks over this stupid item"
"It's a good earphone, battery backup is staying as we expected. Those who are enthusiastic about music better buy other rockersz modelThe noise cancellation not good and continuously using result to pain at ear. That's only cons I would say about it."
Good for listening music but battery and mic are very poor. Not suitable for calling purpose and long usage..Battery drains in 4-5 hours.Other person on call will get breaked voice and will not be able to understand even a single word correctly
Packed securely. Its been 7days till now item is working in a good condition.
Sir nice 👍 price and 🙏product 🙏 good 😌 delivery 🚚 amzozn sir🙏🥳👍🎉
Battery does not last. Battery backup was good for the first few days but started loosing battery life steadily. I have to charge them twice a day.
"Best earphone I have ever used, gets charged soon and work for hours, sound quality is best too."
"A beautiful colour,the sound quality is excellent, absolute sound cancellation ,very comfortable ear buds ,a worthy buy ."
Dec-2019 Amazing sound quality and bass. Great Value for money .  Nov-2019 I am updating my review comment after 1 year of use. This still works like how it worked on day 1 . Really top class.
Initial product was defective ..one side not audible..replace dproduct im using now..good one
"Waste of money. Sound quality is not good,  bluetooth range is also very very poor, it creates disturbing sound even at 0.50mts radius. I bought this set for hands free talk but unfortunately I should hold my phone near to it then only I can hear voice clearly."
Waste of money..Disappointed with the product and even at last right side ear fone is not working and invoice details are also not downloading.God knows meri budhi kab bhrasht hui jo mene ise order kia .
Product is Ok. Sometimes it is getting disconnected automatically. Need to reboot the phone or earphone twice in a day while using continuesly. Sometimes it is working fine. I feel it should be little much better. Then it would be great 👍.
Bluetooth connectivity problem occurred after 10 days from the day I get it Mony waste. I didn't even enjoy it for 10 days and I got a problem. After battery comes to 40% it won't last even for 10min
Please don't buy this item. Bluetooth range is very poor as it doesn't connect even when a single wall is obstructing the signal. Video and sound doesn't sync as well because it is delayed by a few seconds. But boat 255 pro as it way better than this.
Very nice overall performance is really good. Best product for first time users.
I hated one feature of this product. The volume button functioning automatically. It just keeps it at max volume. Even when u reduce it goes back to maximum. And i cant even return the product.
Build quality is good but bass is littlebit low. Sound quality is good.
Music is running very good no problem in listening music but on call both person cannot listen voice clearly in all call. Already one time replace this product but second one is also not good so I request you please don't buy this product.
"Received product with seal open but the product was working fine , problem in displaying battery percentage ,overall not satisfied with the product . Sound quality is good , no issue in connectivity , build quality is also good."
"Worst item, sound is Breaking after  few minutes as you talk or hear music. Even my friend purchased the same headphone she is also facing  the same problem."
Good quality headphones in this price.. sound quality is so good.. and the best part is it can connect to the 2 phones at the same time. But it is not noise cancelling.. But overall it is good..
Good product with good sound quality. Bluetooth connectivity is also good.
Worst product don't buy it I have replaced the product due to the mike issue and but the replaced product also not working properly wherever I use to talk in call voice clarity was not good and people use to say voice is very lowDONT BUY
"Sound quality is great, bass is good, battery is better, very light weight."
A very great product at this price ... Plus I have tried using the same to play a few mobile games (PUBG) there is no lag with the sound or microphone at all ...Perfect for gaming and casual use
When the battery reaches to 40% it shuts down automatically. I kept the full charge of 100% after watching 44min video. Battery came to 40% and then it shuts down.
"Worst quality, I guess this is a out dated product now. Battery backup not even of 3-4 hrs. Get drained in few hrs"
Cracking sound after one week or 10 days of usage.. Thought of returning but return window closed just two days before...
It says 8 hours backup for battery with continous songs being played but mine doesnt even last 4 hours
Very bad connectivity with computer even mic quality not appropriate i have replaced one time and both time i received a product with brand box already open as it was used before... although amazon packaging was great but the brand box was torn...
Great product. Value for money. Great fitting in ear. Voice command feels little different.
Good
"Voice problem in this product.Other person cannot hear your voice when you using earphone.I replaced from Amazon, but same problem in 2nd piece so plz do not buy if you are using for attend phone calls."
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
 It looks like a hollow thing . Gets charged . But it is never detected by any gadgets
This Product by BOAT is good .. performance is too good ..it's sound quality n noise cancellation quality is superb. The only minor problem I faced is that on call it's mic doesn't work properly sometimes...overall If I say it's worth money n good quality product ..❤️
Battery - 5 hoursWorking fine with iPhone 12Sound quality is good
"It's battery 🔋 backup is very good , sound Quality Best, bass very loud 🔊 I am totally happy to buy this product on Amazon I glad to see this types of more headphones in future 🔮 thanks boat headphones to make me happy 😁"
They have mentioned it as sweat proof but it stopped working after one week... totally waste of money
Didn't like the battery backup and its mic connectivity. I use it for office meeting and my colleagues complaint of less voice... didn't expect from boat.
It was good experience it gives a great melodious experience. But it keeps on switch off after the time of 3 months. And it don't switch on and so we have to charge it even if we have the charge in it. Literally it sucks after 3 months sometimes
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
 In this range it gives me the satisfaction...Sound quality is Good....Noise cancellation is little bit hard because it has small light...but no problem....bass quality is ok...overall it is nice one..
"Products sound quality is good, good bass but boat service centre is not a good centre because boat don't repairs our products . It will be day by day register a complaint but not repairs the product so please don't buy this product."
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
" Worst quality of mic. Mic stops working in crowded places, and has to hold Mic and talk in a quiet place.  And after full charge, the battery gets exhausted in 3 hours."
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
 Mike quality is very bad. I have wasted my money for this.Dont buy it
"I got a defective piece. It wouldn't charge after 3 weeks of usage. I got a replacement from the service center and that stopped working after a week. Although the sound is great, it's just not worth it"
Nice headphones. But need more battery life. I think 3 hrs continue listen is enough then need recharge battery
Failed in just couple of days and could able to use for very few days only👎👎
"Battery life is amazing. Body is tough and good quality. Sound quality is good for the range, however, a little uncomfortable when worn for long enough. Switches off if not connected for long."
"Worst quality product, 3 months and it's gone.. one side speaker is no more in use. Unable to fix it also.Do not recommend"
"Won't connect at once, some kind of distruption noise is always coming, after using for few hours a beeping sound will come, sometimes there is lip sync error."
•Good quality sound. But could be better.•It has a powerfull bass but quality could be improved. •Over-all its a nice product.•Battery backup could last for above 8 hours.
It claims to have 10hr of battery backup but hardly it stays for 2-3hrs. The product built quality is also very poor. Would not not recommend any one to buy the same.
Nice headphones but sometimes i am facing a problem with it...the after sale services are not good i am not satisfied with their services.
Average quality of wireless earphones.Battery backup is just 5-6 hours NOT 8 hours as they have mentioned.Very lightweight and thin.
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
 Simply superb with sound battery back up nd calling purpose
"Cons:1. When you  watch video thru this wireless device, the audio and video does not match (major concern i found here)2. Noise cancelation - lot of disturbance due to this issue.3. battery backup is normal only"
On wearing the neckband it is difficult to operate the buttons as I have a bit wider neck
Battery backup is worst It would show 60% battery but after 15 minutes of working it wiuld drain to 10%. It has connectivity issue as wellWhile listening songs if you answer a phone call it would not connect to phone audio immediately.
Product is ok but  but  box was already opend it was not seal packed.I m not thinking that product is genuine. I think its fake. I want my money back plz send original product and  chek packing also  coz i hv paid for original product.
This earplugs are very big for my ear and I didn’t like the way it is designed it’s really very painful for me to use this earphone
"Order received in time only. Sound quality is okay, But Mic is not working properly. When I Connect it to mobile or laptop during a call other side ppl are saying that my voice is not audible. This should be worked more on the mic. Hope my review helpful. Thank you"
I am  using this headphones from 2 two weeksound quality is very goodVoice cancellation is goodBattery backup it's give up to 5 hours with 80% to 100 % volume to continue useBattery charging take large time 2-3 hours
One of the best Bluetooth you can have awesome battery life very flexible very durable nothing like it the best one in the market
मैंने 6 सितंबर को लिया था battery बैकअप बहुत कम है और 40% पर आते ही हर 1 मिनट में battery low बोलता है 40% आने में केवल 2 घंटे लगता है रेंज भी बहुत कम है ओवरआल इस प्राइस रेंज में  ये प्रोडक्ट boat 245 v2  सही नहीं है
"Puchased 1 month back , It will works only 6 to 7 hrs, again will making it charge , otherwise it will not work more than 8 hrs .. sometimes it will off unknown reasons , don't know why ...Any how try for another"
Boat is a good company but this time i am disappointed with the product quality.
"I love this headphone, easy to connect. Sound quality great."
"Not satisfied,  the product is not fulfilled my expectations"
There is an issue with mic after usage of 10 days. The receiving voice is too low seems there is some problem with the mic. Unhappy with a branded company like Boat. Pathetic experience
"If you want best sound and music quality go for wired earphones of Jbl and sony of same price, i have comapred it with my Jbl c100si wired earphones and i found a big difference in sound quality"
Worst product its wrk proper one week only after its nt connect properly after connecting also its nt wrkng again and again we have to disconnect and connect very bad product don't buy this product don't waste u r money better to take gud one
The sound blasts of this quality can definitely damage your ears. This earphones DO NOT provide true sound.
"Value for money, sound quality is decent at this price range"
Good for music listening but worst for calling. Every time voice is breaking during calls with any network
Good product. Sometimes facing issue with Bluetooth connectivity.
This bluetooth earpods are quite good. Serves the purpose.
I am not happy with boat Rockerz 245 wireless bluetooth because it is very useless for you. Sound It is great quality good but build quality very poor
It's worth the pricePros: Battery life and sound qualityCons: Noise cancelation
I always by boat product this headset is amazing at a cheaper price and the delivery was also fast i booked headset today and got it tomorrow in the morning without paying any extra charges .
I have faced the issue in this headphone is I can't able to use it inside the helmet. It is little projective so it's paining while using inside helmet and the magnet of headphone seems little weaker. All other things are very good.
First I had to replace it due to some technical problemSecond time i got a very good pieceO erall i like it
Nice bass and balanced sound. Not as clear as senheiser cx180.
The product bacame faulty with cracking of voice input as well as output after few days... So now cancellation is not possible n hence not using the product
Looking is very simpleSound quality so soBattery is only 3-4 hrsReturn policy should be upto 15 daysDiscount policy is worst...After buy discount increses and i cant return it
I am satisfied to this product. It is better to use whole day and best part of product battery life too good. But I think price should be little drop . overall best product without any problem . boat is boom.
"Its having worst noise disturbance and less compatibility ..not worth for money looks like a cheap product I lost trust on Boat products this time if possible please arrange return ,I don't suggest or want  someone else go for it"
"Earphone is good, its connectivity and mic are good but the seal of the box was not proper as you can see in the pic. Product is good but still seal should be proper. Can't expect more at this price. Will update on further usage."
BIG COMPLAINT.. battery 🔋backup too low. Request all readers not to buy this product from Amazon. Battery back up hardly 3 hrs. Request the supplier to allow return of product 🙏
"Hi,I've received Boat Rockerz 245v2 same day delivered the product.But One ear bud is not working,I didn't expect from Boat / Amazon which poor quality and not quality products sent.Please look inti"
"Worth for the price, clarity and battery life is good. It keeps annoying when the battery is low though. Other than that everything is good"
It's not working with proper way once disconnected with laptop then it's connect automatically for voice not for music same happens with mobile Don't buy. Very Irritated
"Calling feature is not good.It has low quality of audible voice on the other side.You must be careful while sticking such a bad product to a Customer.Being a brand, you should also take care of smallcustomers."
"Great value for money product, must buy on this budget"
I bought it to use with my firestick in the same room. But it fails to deliver seamless sound without any interruption. Even if i stand near to my firestick or tv it has disturbance delivering clear audio.
I don't like this product because of its design. It falls of my ear continuously. Its irritating to use. I wanted to return but they don't accept return. Unfortunately I didn't check before itself if they would accept returns.
Have been using it over a month. It's quality is pretty good. One problem I face sometimes is that it automatically switch off without prompting any voice alert (as it should do when battery is low).
ProsVery easy to useSound quality superbEasy to connectQuick chargeClassy lookVery comfortableConsJab hai hi nahi to likhna kyuBhaiya 1 no product hai just go for it
Really I upset with this product start 2days was good but after 10days the quality was worse while in call the recieve sound hear low and even in music sound low and battery life is more bad I suggest not to bad...
"When it comes to 50% change, then after few minutes it comes to 5%. Very poor battery. And sound is ok."
"Mike condition nor good, the person we conversation can't hear our voice properly.  So don't buy this product.  This is exchanged product  still it has same complaint."
Battery back up is very poor around 3 to 4 hours.It's pretty short so sound ii's it clearly heardSound quality while attending calls is pthetic and does not have the finish of a quality brand
Excellent Product. Very satisfied. Value for money...
Sound quality is very good. Product is too good. But while gaming like other bluetoth neckbands have sound delay it has also sound delay while gaming.

" Whare is the earphone?? Didn't get any earphones, just picked a cable & manual guide."
"It is not comfortable while wearing because of wire coming from the front side. So, i want to exchange it from 235 V2 model."
Boat is ❤. Can't compare boat with any other❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I had purchased this item before 1 month everything is fine but bettery backup is very poor. Whenever the charging comes to 50% it automatically off...bettry draining is too fast....I want to return this product
Every thing is fine. We can get it ata lower rate in Mkt
Bass is great and passive noise cancelling is fine but the only issue faced is audio during calls. But other things are good 👍 and there is a little bit of audio lag during gaming.
"Charging drops off quicklyThere is a suggestion that the rest of the quality is good, just the battery power goes down."
this is the second earphones i have got after i returned the previous ones and still the person im talking with on a call cannot hear my voiceif you cannot give good product then return my money

 Kya yah product exchange ho sakta hai.please help me only eight days acche chala bad mein battery backup only 20 minutes switch off blutooth.Plz exchange
Battery life doesn’t even last for 3-4 hours from first day itself. We have been using from 1 month now. Do consider this review and dont buy this product.
Awesome product....And service also fabulous..Don't think plz order and enjoy friends ..It's a Indian company in famous brand #Only Boat#
"It's a delicate product , so far it has been fine . Voice quality is good ..but I m scared any day ..may incidently get stretched somewhere and one side may stop ."
Sound quality is good but the my concern is of comfort. It does not get properly fix in ears drops frequently in a lil movement while sitting also as its get fall in every 30 sec so what can we do with the sound quality.

 Bahot jaldi kharab ho jayega muskil 2-3 mahina kaam uske baad jaldi cannect nhi hoga earphones ek hi bajega bhai thora mehnga kharido sasta ke chakar me paisa barbad ho jayega
Its sound is awesome specially bass Because of 12mm driver . Battery Life is also very good . But during my first usage i feel that the battery percentage is not show properly but by battery calibration it solved........
Sound quality is so amazing it cuts off all the noisesBattery life you can regularly use it 2-3 hours if once chargedValue for money- The wire could've been more strongOveralll its a good product
Battery lasts actually for 8 hours. Its sound is so much that I could't hear it on full volume.It would be the best product if they could had worked lil more on fast charging and playback time.
Everything is good.. superb but bettry life is lil bit low. And sometime it is very difficult to carry or hang it on neck.  while listening music it'll go here and there again and again.
"Very bad product. You can only make a call, not able to receive calls."
Microphone some time not support.
The price is high compare to the quality of the product.
"Sound quality is good, but some functions are missing, like forward/backward/ next/previous  while listening music. Stop button is not ther or not working. Battery backup is good."
"Good sound nd noise cancelation is  working properly.  But one demerit of this earphone is , even after full charge still earphones are disconnected . I faced this several times.."
Sound quality super best in market in this price
Received a faulty product the synchronisation is not proper and have so much disturbance when connected with laptop. It plays the video further and then we are able to hear the audio not properly synchronised
I bought this boat Bluetooth earphones at 799 and it was very good for sound quality worth for money and it is very fast delivered.
"Product is not working, it is not charging at all, just a month ago I bought this product. Totally disappointed.Waste of money. I seriously not satisfied by this product and I would"
The product is quite flimsy and the charging port is not working within one month of the purchase
I don't understand what people are complainting about. A very decent wireless earphone with good sound quality decent bass and decent battery life for the price you pay. I got it for 800 and at this range I could not find any better earphone.
"After 3 months use, Left side Ear not Working, and i returned the product , after service i got Refurbished piece and its Ear buds not suitable when i used before. I am totally Disappointed on the Product Quality."
awesome product at this price point. sound quality and bass is good.
Battery drains pretty fast and also it doesn't charged pretty quick too other than that its pretty similar to other earphones on sound quality.
Bad sound quality and battery life very low... It's worked 4 hours only
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
 There is charging issue I used this product but its make issue its stop chargingWithout batteries there is no use of this productI want to return back or replacement
Product is not good. Battery discharge fastly means 30% too direact 20% and after 10% automatically off bad product my 1200 money is waste in this product.
"The sound is very loud, i can hear the music out loud like normal phones' volume, which is harmful for ears, i m putting this review after 1 month of using them, i want to know the procedure to claim the warranty..."
"Battery life is average and noise cancellation is not that upto mark for indoor volume level was perfect but in outdoor it's slightly low , my usage is 90% outdoor so it not suit my needs so I returned this product"
Worest it's didn't connect ti laptop and battery suddenly 70% to low battery it's  new one I am shocking don't buy this  no return option and actually I am trying to give 0 rating but that option also not available
Don't buy it because it is inferior quality.
Sound is nice and it's got a great base as well but connectivity issues are there.And i think Amazon gave me duplicate product otherwise it's a good deal.Still sound is Pretty great
Good products but little problems when someone calling you then bluetooth is disconnected after that once again connected
Battery backup is low. Charging time is hig.Calling time sound quality is low
good sound quality 8/10awesome bass 10/10decent battery life 7.5/10build and design 9/10worth the price 10/10overall 9/10
Connectivity issues and sound is not at par standards.. I am regular purchaser Boat products but this time I am not satisfied this product..Please improve product quality...
Sound quality is really good...easy to connect..my all time travel partner🌚🎧
I purchased it on may27 2021It has stopped working after 1 monthN you will never see another pathetic service then this boatCustomer care is the worstSo it's just waste of money
Worst brand! It's been only two months and One side earphone is not working out now! Never I could trust this brand now! Is there a replacement or return available? I would trash it even if this is not replaced !
"If someone have a low budget towards purchasing bluetooth headset, one should definitely opt for it."
mic not so good ... Unknowing sounds produce and week sounds

 Its colour starts ti peel up in 2 months nit that great in this price range you should go with mivi or if u dont want mivi then add 400 rupees more and there's samsung level u for u
Sound quality is very average. Not able to differentiate between the boat and local brand earphone by listening the sound quality of both earphone.
I like the sound quality. Value for money.
"Quality is very good for music and calls. But the biggest draw back is that, it does not have noise reduction/cancellation and your calls picks up any back ground noise more clearly than your voice and the other listener is irritated"
"It's pretty decent, I was worried that while running it wouldn't stay I one place but the neck band is pretty well built. Sound quality is alright. At high volumes the bass cracks and their is a bit white noise."
The airphone is really horrible...after a use of 15days there is a difficulty in hearing...if you receive a call or call a person the receiver on the other side is unable to hear. Really worst buying.I will never recommend for it.
Good product in this doesn't hurt ear while using it unlike JBL.
Sorry had to give one as there was no zero stars
Replace this item for the twice & still received damaged Bluetooth
"Product lasted only fr 1 -2 hr...Then got discharged ,then didn't charged ...Worst product serviced by Amazon.Highly disappointed... They delivered it within 24 hrs but with the faulty product..That's not good."
Good buy! Go for higher varient if in budget.Quality could be better there is some noice disturbance maybe due to bluetooth connectivity error. But overall an amazing product
Better sound quality....3/5Nice Bluetooth connectivity 4/5Build quality is  k.. 3/5 Battery 3/5I have using it for four days ....still now there is no problems......
This was my second earphone of Boat but this time not satisfied. The product is average. Bass was high but sound quality is not soo good.
Superb bass excellent sound quality long batteryComfortable airburd and quick connection.
Best in all ways. In such a price range it is one of the best Bluetooth earphones.

" I don't like it, initially it was good but after a week getting a problem, ...I thought boat was good, I wasted money.Thanks for you service."
Good to use but no noise cancelation. Surrounding  sounds  are also heard by others in meeting. Comfortable  and battery withstands for longer time. Sound quality is nice
"If I call receive during meeting time, after attempt we can't listen voice in this product. So irritated. It's not perfect as per my expectations as compare to boat rockers 225. 😢😢😢😢😢"
Sound quality noise quality and product not bad
"As the title says it has bad bass and the worst thing, the high ping. The gap between sound and video seems too much. I see metal clinking then after minute gap I hear the sound."
Bad sound output and poor quality products
boat head phone 's warranty service not good.They take to much time. And customer care no. Are  alway found busy. After a month they didn't return my earphone.
I order boat headphone from amazone... Its not working properly Charging automatically comming down...  Waste of money..I complain to amazone but they are not taking return... Dont by this product from
First time delivered it's not good but later exchanges good one..Please better check and send to the customer's will be good.Sometimes gift to someone's it's not good if they said not nice.
"Product is very good, charge standup is 8hrs i tested it. Noise cancellation needa to be improved. Overall good product from boat. Using since Nov 2021"
I use it from 3 month and find sudden power of repetidely in off button not working properly after 1 month but till now it became fully damage 😂😂😂😂
Nice product according to the prize 👍
"Does not work, couldn't not listen anything ,no voice with laptop or mobile,just shows it's connected , this series us not good,"
"I have asked for refund , pick up scheduled was for 23th feb 2022 . This being the first time in my Amazon experience , I m not a single call or update for pick of the product. It’s 6th day today."
Awesome product with excellent quality
Product Delivered on 28 of july and today oct 17 it's not working the 1 month return policy of amazon is not applicable But The product warranty is still 1 year so How can i return the Product Immediately??
This model ear phone is problematic don't buy this.... Buy other earphone of boat..... Boat quality is super but about this earphone i m not happy.... Connection losses automatically... N giving problems...
This product has better noise cancellation.. as much near about 70 percentage as per my experience.. but bluetooth connectivity very good it is connect within seconds. And sound quality OMG.....
"I have purchased this in early November,2021 and just after 1.5 months it is not working. I want replacement or money back.Amazon authority, please look into the matter and give me a resolution."
Awesome product with best price I'm a traveler I'm using this Bluetooth freedomlySuggest is without any issues go for buyI bought 2 piecesThanks team BOAT
Very poor quality. Many times opponent complain voice not clear and unnecessary noise created while reconnect. Not sure how to get replacement and it shows return window closed
In this price range this product is good. Only problem in this is it will show u full battery for long time after few hours suddenly battery will show 20% and less then 2 minutes it will be dead.
DO NOT BUY - Battery issue - Incorrect charge statusFaulty battery. won't last more than 30 minutes after 6 months.Cheaters/no QC - Only mass cheap product maker
Gave 1star becoz I think I got the defective piece. Sound quality is good but I am facing connectivity issues and also I have processed the replacement procedure but the order is getting delayed.
Sound quality is great but battery doesn't last long....And there's a frequent annoying voice alert when battery reaches 30%God I hate that  voice alert 😬😡...Trust me you too will hate that🙄
The product was as it is shown in the websiteReally worth buying & value for moneyBoat has given all the additional things such as extra ear buds and a usb wire for charging

Best service .! I got replaced with warranty too
"How to clame warranty, from couples of days it was having trouble in talking and from yesterday it completely stopped working wile talking and now it started disturbances in music also"
Very worst headphone for calls .. always have connectivity problem during calls ...after one week dint expect this low cheap quality from boat
I like this product. Charging takes approximately 1.5 hrs. Stand till 8-9 hrs. Overall sound clarity is good. Bass is not good. It's because of the version may be. Noise cancellation is not bad.
Boat is always good and I got it for Rs.699. Loved it
Recieved 2 days back...earphone button is of new use u neither receive a call nor stop the song by that...in 235v2 earphone vibrates whn u get a call but in this u don't have these stuffs..too bad quality
There is battery life not good it's down in 10 minutes I want to replace that faulty Itom but no one reply and no one to replace that.Not supporting staff in Amazon and boat also.please resolve my problem
Very good product from boat.Satiesfied
"Not reached expectations..Worst experience, like while playing video audio comes first than video comes later unsynchronising between audio and video. Sometimes without any notifications power off."
I purchased this product for 999 and after using it for weeks I realised that this is good for listening music but bad for gaming because it legs the sound.
"I got exact that quality headphone which I was looking for. It's having low bass volume, and high voice volume. Good for attending online lectures and meetings. Battery and connectivity is also good. Perfect fitting in ears."
I'm happy with sound quality  but truely disappointed with battery backup of the product... Its get off in a very short period of time and getting stuck of on and off of the product.
Within one month it's not working properly and call quality was poor charging time take up 3hrs
Bas thik thak hai normal use ke liye
Product was delivered on time from Amazon but product was damaged... Right hear plug was damaged and some noice during call or music sounds. Really worst experience.
I extremely dislike this product and Amazon .they are fooling people with big brand name at low prices but actually providing non functional repaired old product . The boat brand is diminished by Amazon

 Product is good but mic problem and battery backup problem with my boat rckerz bluetooth hetset and all are good only this two problems happens thats why i change my product
"good product have used before ,\many- only two days will see its battery .certainly will recommend others"
As Always boat products are best at sounding.. I have 7 boat products with me... Amazing headphones
"Worst product, very bad charging capacity. The worst thing is whenever connected to a mobile or laptop while meeting, it automatically goes off despite being fully charged."
Thank you Amazon for delivering me a fantabulous product in reasonable price
The battery life of this product is not so good. You will have to charge it everyday even if you don't use it for a playback time of 8 hours as mentioned. So i am not totally satisfied with the product
Product does not up to the mark. Sound quality is not that much as aspected. Ear etching after using it.
Nice product got in sale 12 mm earphones.
Getting echo cant hear other side
I have buy many products of same brand. But this is very poor quality product and one side got stop after 7 days...I think they need to check it from there end
I have used this product for two days. after 100% charging  its battery charge rapidly decreases and suddenly switched off. Battery power is not adequate. Don't buy it if you want good battery backup.
"Just received and tested Sound & Noise Cancellation, Bass is very nice, Noise Cancellation is quite good and product design is also cool."
Poor quality in wireFor changing the song with long press button takes too much of timeWhile bike riding its can't hold ur neckNeck belt quality is also very poor
"one of the best earphones at 800 to850 rupees. i am using it sinces 6 months everything good ,battery is about 6 to7 hours .but if your bugrt is 1000 plz strech it more and buy 255 or 255 pro version."

" I have used for nearly 5months only, now the right side ear buds is fault not working. Kindly replace me with a new set. Its under 1year warrany period too."
When i connect this headphones using bluetooth to my phone the wifi speed automatically slows down.. I do not find the use of this device if we are not able to use our network propoerly when we connect with this device
Battery is great as it runs entre day even if mentioned for 8hrs.Sound is clear and loud.Completely satisfied.
Don't cheat customer this type of product on quality. At least 1hour not come I think mentioned Boat but inside other quality product.I have not satisfied 😭 your product based in Amazon.
"The audio quality is greatVery well designed, 1 hour of continuous use doesn't hurt ears, unlike others"
"I like the way it is designed so flexible , I don't want to suggest anything to improve but if they want they can research more on noise cancelling in my opinion everything i good"
Very good product no doubt on it
First I received a headset which did not even work well. Then I returned it. The second one after 7days creates lot of noise when connected through bluetooth. Now I can't even return this.
"Gets disconnected automatically, it May show 70% charge and may get disconnected next minute. Really disappointed with the product will not recommend to anyone."
"Great Bloothoot headset, Lightweight comfort for ear and also Sound quality is too good. Nice Battery backup."

 The magnetic head repail each other instead of attracting. I have replace the product old obe was also defective it was not getting charged and this one is also defective
I wouldn't suggest this anyone.
"After 10 days of using this product, one major issue I found in this product was, I can able to hear a clicking sound while I'm hearing the music or during watching a movie. I don't recommend this product"
The other party can't hear our sound clearly. Sound can only hear in very low voice. Also the buds are not comfortable. Ear is paining.
Product not upto the mark not as expected from boat brand such a this quality
"Its not so good not so bad product, the quality and sound is not as good as boat other ear phone have it. Bass is not so well u can feel that u are using a cheap quality product"
"The built quality of this product is very low. I purchased this item on 16th November, and the Mic stopped working within 12 days. Another problem is, it is very difficult to switch on the product."
"The product is good,but my personal experience after 2month the battery is not working and switch on problem...Bad Product from BOAT shameful...😭😧😡Also customer care team not responding..."
"Except for the sound, I don’t like anything. The connectivity is horrible, packing was awful the seal was broken as usual the ear buds had cracks. Not worth 1k for anything. Buy it only on sale worth only 600 maybe"
Super Product Excellent Sounds Quality
After 3 month the battery backup only for 15 minutes. I am very disappoint with this product. Can i replace or repair it in warranty if anyone know then tell me my location is Hyderabad.
"Sound quality is good, comfortable in ears and overall performance is good but there is only one problem when we connect it with leplop sound quality got reduce unnecessary noise arises."
All things are great but this earphone is just laging after 5 to 6 months and his limit is dull now from 8 hours to 5  hours this not make any sense to buy it
Hi Sound clarity good noise cancellation good but Battery backup is not good 4hr backup only really disappointing please can you replace this is very help full me. Because of main battery backup.
I purchased many boat products before but this one is very bad. Cheap quality material. Even roadside earphone are better then this. Add 150-200 more and go for another rockerz

" I used this product 1monthJust amazing in this price range good quality, value for money, While Driving and work out boat very usefull"
Sound quality is good but when comes to connect call it's quality is so bad and even with tv connection the sound is so broken. Please go for another product
Very lite waight ... Sound low to other side
Unable to charge thr headphones..... You have given the warranty for boat Rockerz 245v2 wireless Bluetooth headphones.... Requesting you to help on the above issue as soon as possible.
"Simultaneously two or more devices connect and create a hazard situation,It is just wasting money. ...Don't buy it"
First time it was not working after 01 monthAfter replacement it is not working afer two monthsHow can we judge Amazon product that's is selling
Mat lena bhaiPaisa barbad mat karnaBahut gatiya h
"One side was not working when I ordered. After getting it replaced, battery backup is not more than 30mins (while on call)"
There was issue with product and I have placed return. The pickup was done on 13 Dec. And today is 20 Dec and still there is no any payment refund status showing and not credited to my account.
Good brand but not following the trade quality in the low scale products. Try to demolition such manufacturing and make sure to give heigh quality with barable bugs
This my frend buy its ok..?
Sound quality is average. Build quality is third class cheap chinese product.
Waste of money..... Not working properly and not receiving voice at all...... I have ever seen like this  worst ......... worst.....  item
"It is a ver 5 earphone after pairing with desktop (core I 5 desktop of dell having inbuilt bluetooth & wifi), mic was not working."
Such a good product and low cost must buy the product
it is a good quality product.
"Hi friends, I gave connectivity review 1 out of 5 this is my replaced unit due to connectivity issues but I got new one with same problem and am I think this is model issue"
"Quality wise it's really good. But, since it's a bluetooth earphone.. It's connecting range us very small.. Max u can be 5 meters away from your phone & it's a disadvantage"
"Third class services by Amazon. Pathetic experience. Deserve negative star marks. LLM. Product failed, backup not more than 2 hours playback"
Amazing earphones with great sound quality and bass. Person can do good quality calls.. overall experience is great
"Very poor battery backup, vedio streaming when connected bluetooth.Also not showing proper battery percentage."
Good product at this price point.seamless Bluetooth connectivity.decent sound output.battery life also acceptable.value for money product
Song qualities too goodbattery capacity total AmazingAnd charging period is too less..Chota pack bada dhamakaaa
All good but distance was low at 10 mtr it's only 4 mtr
In interconnectivity between phone and laptop it is worthless. Doesn't get connected easily in this case. Also size is not good. Ear starts paining after sometime.
Sound Quality is very poor. As i am music enthusiast i found this headphones lack bass and are somewhat irritating for your ears.
Got dead in 4 months only
"works fine. there is no Wow-factor, as advertised."
"Worst battery backup, from 50% it drops to 0 within few minutes of time"
"Good product, effective sound quality, good charge backup, meeting expectations. Connecting cords are quite thin and need careful handling in some cases."
Everything is perfect in these but the main problem if you are a gamer don't go for this it's better to take a wired earphone of boat but not this one. Also battery  drains faster.
Good enough for me. But the battery after 6months use.
Nice one n recommend. Connectivity good n the audio output is excellent. Thanks to Amazon. Pl continue the good work.

 Amazing earphone i have bought one and shown it to my friends and this time i bought for my friend.
Worst product I ever purchased from Amazon! I couldn't connect it with my calls everytime. Im facing this issue after a month of puchase... I don't recommend this product
GoodBut wire low quality
Waste product. People please do not trust when u see baot products for 999 it means it either defective or damaged one of 100 will work fine. Very bad experience
Nice and comfort. But only one problem i felt. Some times voice not clear (feel like old radio with out frequency) but after switchoff that will clear.
Noise cancellation not to good
"Very good product, good sound  quality,Battery life is not good. Shows 8 hrs of battery life but actually not more than 4 hrs,Overall good product t"
Please don't buy this product. It was cheap 1st copy Not original boat headphone🎧. Cheap china made and name it as boat. I don't know how Amazon approved this.
Super sound and good looking I like that cost... Iam sooooo happy for this boat Rockers Bluetooth earphones thank you soo much Amazon.
"Nice product at the price, however bass effect could have been controlled. Overall worth the price."

Nice colour. The product was well pack by Amazon. Also easy to handle. Great sound. Pickup n sound quality was good...happy with this boat...
You will not regret at all its battery life is perfect And also the sound quality and bass is good
It cancels all noise from out side by that I got scold from my parents for wearing it they calls me but sound not comes in it before taking it be ready to get scold from parents
Battery backup - Maximum if lucky 2 hours.Sound Quality - HorrificOne side earphone stopped working.I would say even Chinese products last longer that this.
"Dislike, while connected on call, a lot of disturbance there , not able to hear clear voice during call.Other features are good, listen music and video are okay."
"First of all its sound quality is Nice , its very comfortable becz of its flexible neckband and its battery backup is awesome ! Best wireless earphone in very affordable price!"
"Sound quality is awesome, proper noise cancellation at this price , awesome bass quality.,it comes with full charged battery 👍😍and awesome color and design."
this product I bought 4 month before and the left ear plug is not working.do not buy this product
"Dont buy this ever, Very bad life. Stopped working in 4 months."
It has  been only 15 days from buying. One side ear phone is not working. Worst headphone ever.
"I bought this product especially for calling. But my experience is not so good so far. Sometimes other caller is unable to hear my voice. Though, it is good for listening to music only."
Overall a good productI brought it  on amazon big india sale.
"A great product with a great deal, easy to operate n hassle free BT connectivity"
"Hello,Received Faulty product, after raise return initiated but not visible return in amazon website as well,"
"What is the warranty as after using six months its not even lasting for 1 hour, from where I can replace the battery"
1200 extra kharch kar ke OnePlus ke earphones le lena lekin isko mat lena jhat.
The product bought is not working which was bought in July
Overall good product
"After 14 days of use, earphone is not working. There is a problem in charging slot. I want to exchange my earphone, the company has sent me damage product."
The earphones have stuttering issues.Sometimes there's no sound and later it returns
Completely satisfied with this product. Very useful for those who use earphones for a long time. Battery backup is super. Sound quality is amazing. Value for money.
Battery backup not Good only two or four hours backup only
Very good product. Worth of money
That was such a nice product and i have brought before this again i have buy from Amazon  tis amazing
Sound is a poorest quality... people had been complaining and I used my original samsung handsfree it is awesome  .. i have paid for brand and I was given a faulty product which I can buy for 100 rupees
I got deceived.. This product doesn't work.. Nor does it get charged!! I need my money back!!
It's actually only has a battery of 5 hours and it does not show the right battery percentage. Even when it says that it is on 100% it's needs more charge to be actually fully charged
Overall good product. But battery back is not good.
"So sad to Book thiS blutooth through the Amazon ,the company show the quality good ,but received product is not good , please help me and support to provide best quality of blutooth."
"Very good battery life,but there is some connections problem during call.. .. while receiving the call sometime the calling person is not able to listen my voice.."
This product is very good and sound quality is awesome this segment but battery backup is not good but this segment is best product. Don't buy anything go for this
Worthy Choice...Everything is Cool...Sound quality 👍Battery life 👍Usb option 👍I am loving it 😍😍😊
Op sound cancellation and qaulity sweat proof I can recommend you it but just a small problem with charging
good product and value for money
"Just after 5 months the on-off button not working, and once it's connected, automatically disconnect within few minutes, and service centers also not available near by, worst product"
Bought this Earphones @800Sound of the Earphones is pretty good for this price range.Battery doesn't last long more than 5 hours.Pretty good Earphones overall for this price range.
"It's just awesome 😌Gifted to my Father, and he is more than Happy 😊 which made my day!! 😀👍"
Nice value for money sound quality is amazing noise cancellation is average and bluetooth connectivity is also good
My advice is that  Battery atleast indicate or gives some notification before discharging..overall good product .
Product is ok but delivery boy ne mere ghar pe delivery diya nahi.mujhe bohut durr jake lena para delivery.So it is very disappointing fir me.Aisa kavi nahi huya mere sath.So mind it.
Average quality of material and sound.
Excellent product.
"Worst quality product, broke with single use. Boat is going down now"
Its my second product that I got in replacement because once my product got didn't work properly and I have 1 year warranty card so I replace this and I got new one thanks amazon 👍
It's just okay. Difficulty in connecting with other devices and also battery life/ charge is also very low
First Of All I Received Already Opened Box. Sound Quality isn't Good As I Expected Truly Disappointed. Only Better in Calling. I Am Already Using INFINITY Wired Headphones And That Is Much Better Than This
Don't buy this because after using of 15days left ear phone not working.
It didn't meet my expectations. It sometimes works fine and sometimes the speaker's voice is not heard on the other side
"Good built quality, sound is good however not happy with mic quality as person on other end is not able to hear or barely hear me. At times it's distorted"
Under 700 this is good
"Mic Quality poor-Disappointing Mic Quality.After 3 months of use, Mic performance deterioted alot.At a distance of just 15cms, mic doest reveice my voice"
"Bettry time is perfect 8 hour,And this is good product,Sound quality not bad, and no very good"
Achha product hai
Some calls are not supporting bluetooth connectivity. Battery playback time is not that much as they have mention in the description.  Led doesn't glow at full charge. Else everything is fine.
"It does the Job, worth buying."
Not goog for talking in phone. The other person cannot hear
Don't buy its really bad. Sound is too low and its a struggle while on a longer calls.  Also  they don't return policy on this.
Totally worst product .. after battery down it tells it every 10second .. battery low... Wtf... And battery last long upto 5hrs
Loved everything about the product 👌
Sound lagging issue is there and it doesn't work properly with MS Teams
Poor build quality. Sound quality horrible. 12mm driver sucks. Crackling noise in Left earbud. Not worth at all of buying this product. Very unhappy. Wishing to return the product.
Very happy with the product
loved the sound quality at this price point
Initially it was good but not working after 3mths.POOR PRODUCT... DON'T KNOW IF IT HAS guarantee periodDon't buy.
Value for money.
Excellent product it's sound is amazing and style of wearing is so cool .I recommend this product to the Amazon customer . I think everyone should try this atlist one time .
Don't go for this product.... Second time I replaced it. But facing same issueMike performance is very bad... The recipient couldnt hear properly
"Within a few minutes of connection, either the other person can't hear me, or it just stops working completely! Invest a bit more and buy a better one."
Mic is especially good. Seamless connection simultaneously with mobile and laptop. Audio volume is a little on the lower side.
"🎧 Very good sound quality, smooth and clear bass also very good🎧, I am happy to buy this boAt Bluetooth😘, Thanks Amazon this deal and thanks also sender 🙏"
"I bought this set 2 month ago from this app, delivery was on time product was perfectly packed, and still working as it was on first day. My first shopping from Amazon was good.."
"In my opinion, Music is not all good. only bass is little good.. No chillnesss and sometimes while in call its get cuts and then connecting. Overall not worth."
Bluetooth often disconnects while on a call. Battery back up is inconsistent. Overall product is not reliable. Boat should discontinue this product right away.
Connect iPhone laptop tv android. Great battery. Good sound. Light weight. Couldn’t ask for anything better for this price 🌟
"After using almost 10days, I'm writing this, by showing the 50%offer , faulty products selling to customers, my one having charging issue, it is not working for half an hour also"
"Overall product is good. battery is decent not that good but acceptable. Bass is strong,mids are awesome, highs are also good but lows are not that good but decent.Overall value for money product"
"Very good product, must buy , boAT rocks , right now enjoying full bass music ."
"It was delivered on 19 January,on 31 st January one of the speaker is not working. Waste product. Iam not satisfied with this boat neck band."
"Battery backup very well and sound, bass is goodbut charge time too large"
"Product is not working, switch off midd of any time, poor qualityThan repleshment  k bad bhi is not working switch off midd of any time very very poor quality  😡😡😡😡😡😡"
Product is GoodBut received in poor condition.The shipping package was damaged and even outer cover was in poor condition. Never expected  this from a brand like Amazon.Hope things will change in future.
works so well.
"First time I get colour missmatch after exchange of this Boat rockerz new one not work properly,during the call or music play automatically disconnected and after few seconds again connecting."
I have used this for about 2 months now and the voice of the other person is breaking in between. Call experience is irritating now.
Dislike - facing delay issue in sound.

 Very bad quality. One hour battery backupLocal footpath item. Not a original item.duplicate
"voice noise problem in  head phone, given for exchange two times but product not picked up and now they are saying product return date over .. now my 799 rs amount gone no use."
Nice quality with this price range. Go for it if you want to purchase under 1000rs.
Battery indication suddenly coming down from 50 - 20%.  Irritational Warning sound/message rising from 30% of battery life.Better go for any other ear phones.
Guys be cautious while buying this product because i did not even have the option to return for this product..Hiss noise when you use it for voice call etc..
Worst product dont buy plz no back up time every time you have charge plz dony buy 100 rupees worth please dont buy cheap product each and every hour have to put charge
The product is good and okay
Initially it was running fine for 10 to 12 days but after that it did not start. calling to customer care for last 3 days but no one receiving call. worst experience.
"Product is very nice , sound quality is super, battery life is too good......"
Battery life is ok but the battery power indicator is an absurd one. Overall Average performance . In this price segment can't expect more.
Please don't buy this and not working for laptop and waste of money
Very worst product 😡😡 battery fully discharged within 2 hours i am totally disagree with this headphone i recommend not to buy this boat headphone 😡😠😠😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😒
niice product
"It's been 1 month since i have purchased these earphones , quality is good but connection is getting lost again and again i am really disappointed."
After 60% battery switch off and disconnect from the device that's very bad I am not recommended to buy anyone I am moving onplus.
The earphones do not work for voice recording purposes
Product is  good but  Amazon services is bad due to not clear information given offer and services
"I have purchased this headphone, but the product was not from boat manufacturer. I received second copy and even battery time is also not good. And there is no option for return also"
Mike is working properly for audio or video callsVoice is breaking for others.Noise cancellation is not as given specification

It is overall nice but because of these between classes you can’t watch a video or listen anything else. It’s battery power is excellent
"Worth paying, quality product."

Good sound
Battery drain issue...lasts only for 4 hours of continuous play.
Awesome product... I am in love with this product... Bcoz of this product... I think that nowadays music become my 1st choice to give  ⚡ to my day

Good quality
"Bass is really cool and noise cancellation gives better experience, About sound quality  I will give 7/10 rating overall budget friendly product and you can buy…."
"2nd time received product but still in bad condition, battery problem, no sound clear, replacement request send but no one came for pick till date. I have lost my Rs.799/-"
One earpiece stopped working after 3-4 months and due to unavailability of service centre not able to replace it so my money got wasted

"The product's sound is good but it doesn't work below battery life of 70, we need to charge it again and then it works. It should work till 10% battery limit"
I don't know which material boat used for this Bluetooth ear phone but trust me look wise it is bad and waste of money I feel... I don't like this... Quality is cheap
"Lot of lag and continuous humming sound when connected to Amazon Fire Stick. Have requested for a replacement, let's see if the replaced product is compatible or not."
Had to change within a monthBut warranty is coveredCheck battery within the purchaseMostly it will fall quickly after 50%
Impressive headphones. Looks good and decent battery backup. Not that happy about the quality of charger provided with the headset

Sound Quality and all sab sahi thii lekin 7 mahine mei wire short ho gayi pehle right ear plug mei sound band hui phir left ear plug mei sound aana band ho gayi.
Need to improve on battery performance.
Earphone is good..sound quality is also good...but if u love bass go for it..if u want clarity then this earphone lacks somewhat in this. Its good at this price.
"बैटरी 2 घंटे से ज्यादा नही चलती, अचानक बीच बीच मे कनेक्शन टूट जाता है। घटिया प्रोडक्ट है। नही खरीदने की सलाह देता हूँ"
Indian boat is best
Best products super sound qualitySounds quality 8/10Bass quality 8/10Battery life 6/10Battery backup not good 30% automatically power off
Can't talk on call by the bluetooth. Very slow voice reached other side in calling. Music is Ok. But get lot of problems by mic in calling. Very disappointed 😞
"it's my first day to use itit is awesome, awesome sound, awesome basstotally awesome in this priceit is totally awesome in this price"
I already a user of Boat products.I started using this new headphones.I can review more after using some days
There is no any brand logo on the USB  cable.  I don't check the product. And also the three is a different dust or markings indicates already opened.  But earbuds are  superb.
Good quality
Good product and good quality but my opinion is at this prize of 999 is little higher and it is reasonable price is 600 to 800 is good prize of product.otherwise quality is very good.
Good and perfect bluetooth headphone BOAT superb
"Bluetooth disconnects automatically during call, I requested for refund but replacement option is available,what to do next customer care is not giving refund,"
sound is very nice and easy to connect the any phone
Sometimes sound blurredConnectivity goodBattery backup 4 hour once fully chargedTake 1 or more hour to full charge
The product is overall good but the box was damaged and even the seal was open on the box. May be someone has already opened the box before the delivery.
Good
Blindly go for it
"After use 3 months this nackband. Battery backup only 2 hours, Playback Time 2 hours only, Very Disappointed ..."

Received box seal opened item which is not acceptable.Colour also not attractive.Black is good in all of these colours.
All things are okay but issue with battery backup not as per expected as brand committed. Battery has been finished with in the 5-6 hours rather than 8 hours.
"Very bad performance, speaker set stop worling in a month only..never ever buy it..worst experience"
bass is to high sometimes covers the mids but there will be no issues with mid volume
"Sound quality is super, battery backup is also good, like this product, sound quality is good, value for money 👍."
Not bad at all👍Not satisfy with sound quality🤙Pbetter backup👌Not comfortable to use👎But not bad at this price segment 👍
It is very light and easily bendable don't take extra place to keep and sound quality is comfortable for ears.easy to use.
"Light weight, good battery life, value for money, classy and elegant. Recommended for students and office going personnel."
The product is absolutely awesome👌...If you're a music lover it's perfect for you... battery backup is also very nice...I would just say the product is very good 👍
"In that price it is a nice nackband sound quality is good ,but battery backup is 7-8 hour's only if you want to buy a nackband for basic use than purchase it"

"Can't use this product for attending the call,, everyone complaining we can't hear you... don't buy this product ....we can use it for only listening musics"
Worst product don't buy any of the boat product specially from Amazon. No customer support and not able to download invoice also.
Awesome
All of a sudden the battery charge is started reducing from 70% to 45% to 20% to 8% and switched off. Battery charge standby is not upto the mark.
"First product from Amazon which i got problem that to two times Voice Issue, Disconnecting between calls, Noise disturbance while listening songs."
Good Quality Product
Use after one month sound quality good battery backup upto 4-5hours continue use ranch upto 10 meter no noise issue product  much better.
Good earphones. One disadvantage is that it discharges very quickly from 50% to 0%(around 5-10 minutes). Even though works for 4 -5 hours from 100% to 50%.
"I'm totally disappointed with damage product that headset not giving any warning while increasing volume up,like increase more volume will damage your ears"
Amazing
Very good product value on the price sound is very good
"Old Headphones, Usable headphones  Missing Accessories, Missing Additional airburds, Missing warranty card.3rd class service, Duplicate product"
Very bad.. being a boat product I expected it to be good.. but I m highly disappointed.It did not even worked for a week.. All my money wasted.
While listening for some hours...I felt some pain around my ears...and then it started headache... it may be cause of over bassy
Now I want Ibuy one more but price is high 300 more...
Right earpiece stopped working within a month
"Its old model from boat , quality and sound it's not upto expectation ,"
Didn't start after 10days of use.

Ordered this product. Good quality
The sound quality is quite good though there is a scope of improvement in the bass and overall sound quality experience but its worth it at this price.
"Sound is absolutely trash. The audio output has ony bass, the mids and highs are absolutely missing. Trash product."
"Not value for money,  opposite person feel less sound quality"
"Sound is goof, battery back up is also good but it disconnects automatically on calls, zoom while watching something online."
iam feeling very happy about this product
"Excellent product go for it, it has 12mm dynamic drives."
One earphone was stops working after 10 days with out any damage from my side.Earphones were good with regards of quality wn those were working.
Product is good and sound is clear but packaging of products of box is not good
Ordered on June 21Oct 1 voice stopped workingOct 14 Charging but cant. Switch onSo its worth of 5 months. Thats it
Untill battery 60 percent it's good but after that battery level goes down like hell...overall sound and call experience is good....
Hai Guys this headset good sound quality 12mm is original product by boat always good boat fully satisfied.
Good product. Not so good in making call most of the time...
Audio quality seems fairly good but my major complaint is that the mic is not proper at all.
i tried to connect these earphones but couldnt connect to any device. Very bad bluetooth connection and very poor mic quality.Not at all recommended.
Awesome headset
Really good product worth the money you pay… definitely recommend
Nice product
"Sorry sound,bas quality is very very poor.no base this head phone.i expected more but not fully satisfied."
fitting is not so good i cant understand the use of that round structure instead of ear hooks please anybody explainsound quality is not amazing above 60%.All the rest things are very ok.
It gets disconnected iitself. It create a big problem when I am in mid of an important concall of company.
Good product but build quality can be better
Sound is too high
Lack.of clarity at full volume.Build quality = 5/10Got it for 915Expected better!
Good bass nice quality must buy worth for money lite weight and easy connection must try this guys
Very difficult to use.It does not catch my sound.I have to keep my microphone near my mouth while talking. It has poor battery backup also.
Very bad experience. I think this model had a problem.Return the product twice but the  problem remains the same.Sound issue and calling issue
Person on other side of a call.. can't hear the voice.It is a complete waste of money
Out going call mick voluem is very low pls exchang this product
"not good , finding difficulty in connecting to my MI phone and lof distrubance also"
Sound quality and battery life is decent although sound gets broken sometimes..bluetooth connectivity gets lost within 10m..overall  decent  headset
"All over product is not value for money,In this earphone 1 side ears gone foulty in 2 month so not durable."
Bass effect is less battery is good

" I want to return thts it, it's bad quality , it's not boat headphones , not worthy as a price"
"The head phone (boAt Rockerz 245v2 Bluetooth Wireless in Ear Earphones with Mic Teal Green) is not working properly. What can we do, kindly advice."
It gets disconnected frequently while playing music and videos
Expected better quality most of the times Bluetooth don't connect needs serious attention in production.
Sound quality and noise cancelation is good  bass quality is not very good.  Overall good for normal use
"Left said sound come wright side sound not come, and services centre also very bad"
Bought it for 800RS on sale. It's worth for the money. Good one and stylish
Audi is good though but built quality and overall experience of this headphones feels very cheap
It is pure value for money. Best headphones used till date at this price point.- DBS VLOGS
"""Sound quality "" is awesome.. Excellent quality product at a Reasonable price.."
Product stop working in between calls . From 100% battery charges goes to switch off within 15 minutes. Please replace my product with another one
It's has a good bass boosters ear fitting is most thing I liked build quality is average it could have been better overall nice wireless earphones
Bluetooth unstable gets disconnected every 10 to 15 mins.
"I guess this is an AI powered earphone,it has this strange sense to figure out that exact time in a office call to stop working."
Battery backup is quite goood. But sound is not upto the mark. Go for rockerz 255 pro it's better. 245v2 sound is not goood bas is also not there.
Battery backup bilkul bekar hai ek baar 100% charge karne pe 3 to 4 Hours music play karta hai uske baad battery phir charge karo bilkul bekar hai
Very good product
"Good bass and noise cancellation. The connection for Bluetooth doesn't reach much far. Overall, satisfied with the product."
"Average while listening music, for normal call communication it's ok"
Crackers type sound while listening music and calls
Stopped working after a month. Max of the people have same complaints. It is good when working but stopped working after a month
It was ok till 3month but now i am facing problem..The other side of person  can't hear my voice i want to replace
Not happy one side of it is not working not even a month now
"Product is good but battery backup is not as it claimed on product ,playtime is up to 5to 6hrs."
Best product in reasonable price..Sounds good...Strong battery capacity as expected
M not a music editor or something like that...M just a regular lover of music and these earphones just fit right into my budget and the bass is great with best in class mid's.
"Worst product I ever buyed, the shipping and warranty claim is extremely fraud don't ever wish to show this kind of service, or else I'll sue you"
"It is good products, light weight but only thing is that range even if ur a way away it gets disconnected. Every thing is fine."

Value for money
I bought this on 12th Nov 2021It works properly when I bought but for a past 2 days my voice not received on call by opposite person
"Product is value for money. I purchased this  for 1000rs.Sound 3/5,Battery 3.5/5, 8 hrsBluetooth v5 uses less power. Saves mob. Battery as well. Works 7 to 8meters in open areaCalling/mice is good."

Overall good quality but battery life is not good
"Good balanced sound . Call quality good , but battery backup is 4 to 5 hours on 80% volume . A good product for the price during Amazon sale  Rs. 800"
Need to improve noise cancellation feature. Also it does not notify for low battery and switch off while talking. Other wise it's good.
"Giving feedback after 2 months use of this product ,relatively product is nice at this price range completely satisfied with this product, nice"
"I replace it twice , i got broken seal second time .When battery reach 50% , after 5 minutes it reaches 0% , directly switch off"
"Sound quality mast he, Sab thik thak he lekin bettery back-up thoda kam he. Ise continue use karoge to maximum 7hrs. Battery back up very poor."
The battery is very bad

Neck support should be strong. And the option should be in both side of the speaker. Otherwise all is well.

Ye product duplicate hai battery 3 se 4 ghante me khatm ho jati hai .
I like this earphones but their battery life is not that much
Bluetooth connectivity is not upto the mark. Some time it lags behind. Maybe a codec problem.
Sound quality was so bad. It looks ordinary sound quality. Not expected from brand like boat.
Head phone bud quality is not good .I want refund
No complain on product quality. But Amazon's packing is very poor.Inside box was opened and cracked
"Bass is gud, quality is bit not that good. Usually when we recieve calls it's not connecting."
After using 2-3 days i know that sound is good but it discharge so fastly after 50% of charge
"The product is as expected,has good sound quality. satisfied with the delivery it was on time"
Excellent headphone

Charging issue. Showing 100% battery and after half an hour show 30% without doing much use.
"Good product and voice is also very clear, very flexible to wear and ear buds are also good."
"It's not working, how will you assess sound quality."
"It's 12mm driver is so powerful as compared to ""Infinity glide 120"" as it produces a extra deep bass with clear sound."
This earphone is bad because it does not sound right and calling may be the biggest problem.
It is good product
"This is the one for music lovers,calling under 1000."
